Results from this new post-hoc subgroup analysis will be presented at the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL.&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>EMERALD is a Phase 3 registrational trial that demonstrated statistically significant PFS with elacestrant versus SOC endocrine monotherapy (fulvestrant, letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane). Based on these results, the U.S. Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration (FDA) approved ORSERDU (elacestrant) on January 27, 2023, for the treatment of postmenopausal women or adult men with ER+, HER2-, ESR1-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following at least one line of endocrine therapy. ESR1 mutations are present in up to 40% of ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancers, and they are a known driver of resistance to standard endocrine therapy.&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>Importantly, a previous subgroup analysis of the EMERALD PFS results, which were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) 2022, demonstrated that the duration of prior CDK4/6i treatment was positively associated with longer PFS on elacestrant but not with SOC. For patients with &lt;u>ESR1-mut&lt;/u> who were treated with CDK4/6i for &amp;ge;12 months prior to randomization on EMERALD, elacestrant achieved a median PFS of 8.6 months versus 1.9 months on SOC, with an absolute difference of 6.7 months, and a 59% reduction in the risk of progression or death (HR=0.41 95% CI: 0.26-0.63).&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>In this new analysis to be presented at ASCO 2023, researchers evaluated treatment with elacestrant in a subgroup of patients with &lt;u>Non-Detected ESR1-mut&lt;/u> enrolled in the EMERALD study with rapidly progressing disease. Results for patients whose disease progressed within six months of CDK4/6i therapy demonstrated a median PFS of 5.32 months for the elacestrant arm, compared to 1.87 months for patients who received SOC (HR 0.518; 95% CI: 0.216-1.165).&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Endocrine therapy given in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor is a mainstay in ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer for first-line treatment. It is encouraging to see that patients with &lt;u>ESR1-mutations&lt;/u> who had a longer duration of prior CDK4/6i therapy, when treated subsequently with elacestrant, had 8.6 months of median PFS versus 1.9 months with the standard of care, as we published at SABCS in December 2022. Until now, elacestrant&amp;rsquo;s potential benefit in patients with &lt;u>Non-Detected ESR1-mutations&lt;/u> was an open question. The results presented at ASCO 2023, while exploratory, suggest that treatment with oral elacestrant following disease progression within six months of CDK4/6i treatment for &lt;u>Non-Detected ESR1-mutations&lt;/u> may provide clinical benefit for these patients, and warrant further study,&amp;rdquo; said Virginia Kaklamani, MD, DSc, breast medical oncologist and professor of medicine, UT Health San Antonio, MD Anderson Cancer Center.&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>Safety data were consistent with previously reported results. Most adverse events (AEs), including nausea, were grade 1 and 2, and no grade 4 treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were reported. Only 3.4% of patients receiving elacestrant and 0.9% receiving SOC discontinued therapy due to any TRAE. No deaths assessed as treatment-related were reported in either arm. No hematologic safety signal was observed, and none of the patients in either treatment arm had sinus bradycardia.&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;At Menarini Group, we are focused on developing innovative solutions that address the greatest unmet needs in cancer treatments,&amp;rdquo; said Elcin Barker Ergun, CEO of the Menarini Group. &amp;ldquo;ORSERDU represents an important step towards that, providing the first and only FDA-approved oral endocrine therapy after 20 years, for advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- tumors with ESR1 mutations. This new data advances our understanding of further potential areas where elacestrant may help patients living with metastatic breast cancer who have limited treatment options.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;br />&#xa;&lt;strong>2023 ASCO Annual Meeting Presentation Details&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xa;Abstract Title: &lt;strong>Oral elacestrant vs standard-of-care in estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative (ER+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) without detectable ESR1 mutation (EMERALD): Subgroup analysis by prior duration of CDK4/6i plus endocrine therapy (ET)&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xa;Abstract #: 1070 | Poster Bd #: 291&lt;br />&#xa;Session Title: Breast Cancer &amp;ndash; Metastatic&lt;br />&#xa;Session Date and Time: June 4, 2023; 8:00AM CDT, Hall A&lt;br />&#xa;Presentation Type: Poster&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;br />&#xa;&lt;strong>About the EMERALD Phase 3 Study (NCT03778931)&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xa;The EMERALD Phase 3 trial is a randomized, open label, active-controlled study evaluating elacestrant as second- or third-line monotherapy in ER+, HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients. The study enrolled 478 patients who had received prior treatment with one or two lines of endocrine therapy, including a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Patients in the study were randomized to receive either elacestrant or the investigator&amp;#39;s choice of an approved hormonal agent. The primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) in the overall patient population and in patients with estrogen receptor 1 gene (ESR1) mutations. In the group of patients whose tumors had ESR1 mutations, elacestrant achieved a median PFS of 3.8 months vs 1.9 months on the SOC, and reduced the risk of progression or death by 45% (PFS HR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.77) vs SOC.&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;br />&#xa;&lt;strong>About ORSERDU&amp;reg; (elacestrant)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;strong>Indication&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xa;ORSERDU (elacestrant), 345 mg tablets, is approved by the U.S. Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of postmenopausal women or adult men with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, ESR1-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following at least one line of endocrine therapy.&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>Full prescribing information can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orserdu.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>www.orserdu.com&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;br />&#xa;&lt;strong>Important Safety Information, ORSERDU&amp;reg;&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xa;Warnings and Precautions&lt;/p>&#xa;&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa; &lt;li>&#xa; &lt;p>Dyslipidemia: Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia occurred in patients taking ORSERDU at an incidence of 30% and 27%, respectively.
