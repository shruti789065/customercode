His discoveries have changed cardiology in the last decade. In this interview, he talks about his past as an established tennis player, his education by the Jesuits, his role as a personal physician to Pope John Paul II, and the relationship between faith and science. But his paramount interest is in young people: enjoy the story of when he became a character on the Muppets Show, called ValentÃ¬n Ruster, to promote prevention and healthy lifestyles!"
