"1187","Guy E. E.","Boeckxstaens","","","72758","In 1987, following my medical studies, I embarked on a PhD program in Neurogastroenterology during which we discovered that nitric oxide (NO) was the main neurotransmitter of the inhibitory NANC innervation in the gut. This discovery was published in Nature in 1990 (>950 citations). In 1994, I finished my clinical training in Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology and was invited to join the clinical staff of the division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology in the Academic Medical Center (AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), a world-leading center in the field of Gastroenterology. I was attracted to set up a Neuro-gastroenterology Unit encompassing both clinical care and basic and clinical research in this area. To gain more skills and knowledge in this area, I had an additional six months training in 1995 in the world-leading center located in Adelaide, Australia. On my return, I started a clinical diagnostic unit equipped with state-of-the-art recording systems and I organized outpatient clinical care. Within a few years, my unit became a referral center within the Netherlands for patients with motility disorders. In parallel, I continued my basic research and shifted my focus towards neuro-immune interaction and the impact of inflammation on gut function. We discovered that the vagus nerve modulates the intestinal immune system, a finding published in Nature Immunology in 2005. To date, my basic research in the field of neuro-immune interaction and neurogastroenterology is internationally recognized as pioneering. To date, I have been promotor or co-promotor of 41 PhDs. When I left the AMC in 2007, my group consisted of more than 20 scientists and is still internationally recognized as one of the leading groups in our field. In 2007, I obtained an Odysseus grant and returned to Belgium. I was appointed as a full professor in Medicine at KU Leuven and the division of Gastroenterology at the University Hospital Leuven. I started a new research group focusing on neuro-immune interaction within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and was awarded with an ERC Advanced Grant in 2013 (CHOLSTIM) and in 2019 (NEUMACS). My group currently consists of 4 postdocs, 9 PhD students, 1 trial nurse and 2 lab technicians."

Most recently I published findings from a nationwide study on early life exposure to air pollution and asthma onset (Pedersen et al. 2023). This study utilized a state-of-the-art exposure assessment, detailed, high-quality data on asthma, and advanced statistical methods. The success of this study was the results from collaboration, infrastructure, and skills I have developed over the past decade. The findings strengthen existing evidence, and the paper complements my other studies on lung function, traditional and novel asthma-related biomarkers in children (Tingskov Pedersen et al. 2023) and asthma incidence in adults (Liu et al. 2021). My ERC funded research aims to develop and apply biomarker-based methods for improvement of the exposure assessment of prenatal exposure to acrylamide from diet (Pedersen et al. 2022). Finally, I have contributed to several influential environmental papers on birth weight, most recently on nitrate in drinking water (Coffman et al. 2021) that has inspired me to further investigate the health effects of agricultural exposures in early life.

Beccaria di Milano, Luglio 1979; ▪ Laurea in Medicina e Chirurgia presso l’Università degli Studi di Milano Ottobre1985 con tesi sperimentale dal titolo “Utilità clinica della correlazione fra Antigene Carcino: Embrionario (CEA) e Tissue Polypeptide Antigen (TPA) nella diagnostica del carcinoma polmonare”. SPECIALIZZAZIONI ▪ Tisiologia e Malattie dell’apparato Respiratorio, tesi “Radioterapia e farmaci sinergizzanti nel trattamento dei tumori polmonari non a piccole cellule” (1988); ▪ Chemioterapia, tesi “La diagnosi di pneumopatia citomegalica in pazienti portatori di trapianto polmonare e cardio-polmonare” (1993); ▪ Anestesia e Rianimazione, tesi “L'emodinamica polmonare nelle pneumopatie interstiziali: rilevanza e significato prognostico” (1997); PRINCIPALI LINEE DI RICERCA Malattie vascolari polmonari Nel campo delle malattie vascolari polmonari gli studi intrapresi e pubblicato hanno contribuito a acquisire nuove conoscenze sulla prevalenza dell’ipertensione polmonare in alcune malattie parenchimali come l’istiocitosi, la linfangioleiomiomatosi, la fibrosi polmonare idiopatica, sul significato prognostico e su nuovi possibili approcci terapeutici. Il candidato partecipa anche a registri nazionali sull’embolia polmonare con l’U.O. di Medicina Generale dell’Ospedale San Giuseppe da lui diretta (COPE – Principal Investigator) e a altre iniziative di ricerca sul piccolo circolo. Malattie fumo correlate Gli studi effettuati hanno contribuito al miglioramento diagnostico delle malattie di questa categoria (DIP-RIBALD-Istiocitosi a cellule di Langerhans), con in particolare una miglior definizione del ruolo del BAL e delle biopsie transbronchiali. È stato inoltre approfondito il ruolo della TAC e dei nuovi software di quantificazione morfometrica delle lesioni polmonari. Infine, in collaborazione con altri specialisti si sono approfonditi gli aspetti internistici della istiocitosi polmonare (es. disordini endocrinologici-aspetti radiologici) LAM Nella produzione scientifica degli ultimi anni è stato sottolineato il ruolo dei meccanismi patogenetici di recente identificazione e valutata l’azione terapeutica della castrazione medica e di nuovi farmaci inibitori del mTor. È in corso di studio l’utilità di un inibitore delle tirosin kinasi (investigator initiated study). È stato definito il ruolo del BAL e biopsie transbronchiali. Anche per questa patologia cistica, così come per l’istiocitosi, è stato poi approfondito il ruolo della TAC e dei nuovi software di quantificazione morfometrica delle lesioni polmonari. Fibrosi polmonare idiopatica Gli studi condotti hanno permesso un miglioramento del percorso diagnostico e della gestione delle complicanze e delle comorbidità. Si è approfondito il ruolo prognostico di indicatori funzionali come il test del cammino. È stata avviata una attività di diagnosi attraverso criobiopsia trans-bronchiale. Si è inoltre partecipato a numerosi trial randomizzati e controllati su nuovi farmaci, incluso gli studi registrativi sul pirfenidone e del nintenabid, primi farmaci disponibili per la cura di questa patologia. Malattie rare polmonari Particolare impegno è stato profuso alla conoscenza e all’approfondimento dello studio di tutte le malattie rare polmonari, a aspetti comuni di problematiche diagnostiche e di disegno di studio. Insufficienza respiratoria avanzata: numerosi lavori hanno esplorato le possibili terapie mediche e chirurgiche di questa condizione le loro complicanze, comprese le patologie infettive e post-trapianto. Enfisema-BPCO-tumore l’interesse per la patologia oncologica si è spostato negli anni dal trattamento con nuovi farmaci e strategie chemioterapiche all’associazione fra enfisema e tumori (ad es. nello screening con TAC spirale dei fumatori a rischio in studi collaborativi effettuati con i due principali gruppi italiani all’avanguardia in questo settore-IEOR e INT), al ruolo dell’infiammazione nell’enfisema e alla sua terapia medica e chirurgica, includendo la chirurgia di riduzione volumetrica e le limitazioni funzionali all’exeresi chirurgica. Inquinamento ambientale e malattie respiratorie Negli ultimi anni, grazie anche alle collaborazioni sviluppate con altre istituzioni ha sviluppato alcuni progetti scientifici e pubblicato lavori sull’interazione tra inquinamento atmosferico e patologie respiratorie con particolare attenzione alle malattie rare.

"1836","Sarah","Howles","","","75548","I am a clinician scientist with an interest in the genetic architecture of urological conditions; my group focuses on the mechanisms leading to nephrolithiasis. Ongoing and recently completed projects that I would like to highlight include: 1. Defining genetic and metabolic risk factors for kidney stone disease. Using data from the UK Biobank, FinnGen, and Biobank Japan we have undertaken genome wide association studies of kidney stone disease to increase understanding of the genetic factors that lead to this disorder. These studies have enabled the identification of variants associated with kidney stone disease and implicated vitamin D metabolic pathways and perturbations of CaSR-signalling in the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis. Furthermore, the generated data has allowed us utilize Mendelian randomization to demonstrate that increasing adiposity leads to a greater risk of developing kidney stone disease via alterations in calcium homeostasis. We are currently undertaking studies that leverage metabolomic and proteomic data released by the UK Biobank to identify the metabolic pathways that underlie these observations. 2. Identifying novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of kidney stone disease. Using Mendelian randomization and co-localization techniques, we have identified three proteins that may represent novel therapeutic targets to prevent kidney stone disease. We are extending our studies to identify additional drug targets and undertaking phenome-wide association studies to reveal potential off-target effects of medications. 3. Functionally characterizing genetic variants associated with kidney stone disease. Using ATAC- and ChIP-seq we have undertaken functional fine-mapping of disease associated variants in renal cell lines. Via Chromatin-capture techniques, we are mapping effector variants to causal genes and investigating the effects of the proteins encoded by these genes on cellular function. In addition, we are functionally characterizing rare variants associated with disease phenotypes in vitro and using drugs to modulate biological pathways. Selected publications: 1.

My area of focus is understanding the origin of phenotypic variation of the human phenotype with aging and how they contribute to physical disability, in order to identify potential targets of prevention and cure. Over the last 30 years, I have participated in designing, consolidating, analyzing, and publishing results from some of the largest epidemiological studies on aging performed in the United States and Europe. My current interest is studying the biological, phenotypic and functional manifestations of aging and how damage accumulation across these metrics is modulated by resilience mechanism that have been evolutionally selected over millions of years. My goals included the identification of the environmental stressors that affect the speed of aging and understanding how these stressors are sensed and encode response mechanisms that are compensatory in nature but that can results in accelerated damage accumulation later in life. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to the science aimed at slowing down the aging process, therefore preventing some of its negative consequences on physiology, pathology, physical and cognitive function, and quality of life."

A noted researcher, Dr. Pfeffer, along with his late wife, Dr. Janice Pfeffer, and Eugene Braunwald MD, is credited with introducing the concept that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) could attenuate adverse ventricular remodelling following myocardial infarction and that this use would result in a prolongation of survival and other clinical benefits. Since this initial discovery, he has had a principal role in several practice-changing clinical outcome trials. He is well known for exploring the interfaces between renal and cardiovascular diseases. An internationally recognized expert in the field of cardiology, Dr. Pfeffer was recognized by Science Watch as having the most ‘Hot Papers’ (highly cited) in all of clinical medicine and was listed as one of the highly influential biomedical researchers of 1996-2011 in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation.

He initiated the research on the role of NOS in cardiomyocyte contractility, currently extended in the context of myocardial remodelling, e.g. in response to catecholamines and beta-adrenoreceptors. His group also provided seminal observations on the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction by LDL-cholesterol and pleiotropic effects of hypolipemiant drugs (e.g. statins) on the endothelium. JL Balligand and his group developed these research directions as associated partner of a Leducq Foundation-funded transatlantic network of excellence in cardiovascular sciences (http://www.leducq-transatlantic-network.org ) and of the FP6-EUGeneHeart consortium (http://www.eugeneheart.eu) that laid the ground for innovative research in therapeutics for heart failure. He also coordinated several collaborative programmes (Concerted Actions, Interuniversity Attraction Pole) funded by the Politique Scientifique Fédérale. He coordinated the Clinical Trial “Beta3_LVH” (www.beta3lvh.eu) that tested the repurposing of the beta3-adrenergic agonist, mirabegron for the prevention of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (funded by a European Commission Horizon2020 grant). Recently, he developed initiatives towards the application of systems biology approaches for complex medical diseases, such as long COVID syndrome (funded by the SOFINA Solidarity Fund), currently extended in Wallonia through FEDER funds and internationally through collaboration with the “Network Medicine Alliance and Institute” (https://www.network-medicine.org/). He is Principal Investigator within the Walloon Excellence Research Institute (WEL-RI; Welbio section; https://welri.org/cms/c_11740011/en/welri).

My clinical focus is cardio-oncology and cardio-immunology. My clinical interests overlap with my laboratory focus, where we are investigating the mechanistic underpinnings of cardiovascular sequelae of novel targeted and immune-based cancer therapies. Since 2016, a major focus of my clinical and research program has been the interaction between the cardiovascular and immune systems. Our group initially described a novel clinical syndrome of fulminant myocarditis that arises from (ICI) immune checkpoint inhibitors (Johnson et al, NEJM, 2016). We further defined the clinical characteristics of ICI-associated myocarditis (Moslehi et al, Lancet, 2018) and showed that cardiovascular sequelae of ICI include pericarditis, vasculitis and arrhythmias (Salem et al, Lancet Oncology, 2018)."

He has a broad clinical interest in the entire field of cardiovascular medicine from prevention (hypertension, lipid disorders, diabetes) to coronary artery disease (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction) to heart failure. He is an expert in pharmacotherapy and a trained interventional cardiologist regularly performing cardiac catheterisations and percutaneous coronary procedures (balloon angioplasty and stenting) as well as non- coronary interventions (percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale, TAVI and renal nerve ablation). Professor Lüscher has mentored numerous physicians and scientists from from 15 countries. Research interests Professor Thomas Lüscher's research is translational in nature and focuses on vascular disease, specifically: • the role of endothelium-derived mediators in the regulation of vascular tone and structure • platelet-vessel wall interactions • coagulation in ageing • hypertension • lipid disorders • atherosclerosis. More recently, inflammation and heart disease - particularly in acute coronary syndromes - has been at the centre of his interest. The Institute for Scientific Information has rated Professor Lüscher in the top 0.5 per cent of most cited scientists worldwide. He has obtained numerous research prizes and prestigious lectureships worldwide. Publications Professor Lüscher has published extensively, authoring or co-authoring over 500 original research articles and more than 200 reviews, book chapters and monographs. He is a member of many editorial boards and from 2004 to 2008 was Associate Editor, Europe, for the journal Circulation.

"3461","François","Mach","","","67767","Prof. François Mach (h index >50), born in 1961, is an expert in the field of cardiology, in particular with regard to the development and progression of atherosclerosis diseases. After obtaining his MD at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, he studied internal medicine and cardiology at Geneva University Hospital. He then went on to complete a post-doctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Prof. Peter Libby, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston (1995-1999). Following his return to Switzerland in 2000, he became full Professor of cardiology, and in 2006 he was appointed Head of the cardiology department at Geneva University Hospital. Between 2012-14, he was the President of the Swiss Society of Cardiology. François Mach is the author of more than 400 high impact factor publications, has obtained several European research grants (“European Vascular Genomic Network” [EVGN] FP6, “Inflammation and Vascular Wall Remodelling in Atherosclerosis” [AtheroRemo] FP7), and is currently involved in the Athero-B-Cell FP7 (Targeting and exploiting B cell function for treatment in cardiovascular disease, all funded by the European Community. As director of the cardiology basic science laboratory at the Faculty of Medicine University of Geneva, Prof. François Mach and his research group have developed animal models of atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial ischemia and ischemic stroke. During the last 10 years, the group of Prof. François Mach has substantially contributed to a better clarification of the inflammatory mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and its acute dramatic complications, such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, both in human cohorts and animal studies. For several years now, Prof. François Mach has also been strongly implicated in clinical research in the field of prevention, especially lipidology, by contributing to the design and completion of several clinical research projects and multi-center studies focussed on lipid lowering agents, such as statins and, more recently, anti-PCSK9 mAb. In addition, he is also responsible of several Swiss cohorts of atherothrombotic patients, and is one of the 3 co-chairs of the ESC /EAS 2019 Lipid Guidelines that were published on August 31, 2019, as well as co-chair of the ESC 2021 Prevention Guidelines that will be published on September 2nd, 2021."

My gastric cancer research agenda focuses on defining 1) Helicobacter pylori virulence factors that contribute to cancer risk, 2) non-invasive markers for advanced premalignant and malignant gastric lesions, and 3) reasons for population disparities in cancer incidence. My analyses of cancer registration data indicate that the epidemiology of gastric cancer in the United States is changing. Current trends foreshadow expected reversals in both falling incidence and male predominance among non-Hispanic whites. Dysbiosis of the gastric microbiome associated with modern living conditions may be increasing risk of autoimmune gastritis and consequently noncardia cancer."

I worked extensively on air pollution and on combined effects of air pollution, noise and green space. I enjoy environmental epidemiology because it provides critical information for addressing health concerns within society. Health impact assessment of built environment factors is another line of research I worked on intensively. Teaching environmental exposure assessment, environmental epidemiology and health impact assessment is another passion. I served in panels integrating the evidence on health effects of environmental stressors and providing policy advice, including the IARC assessment of carcinogenicity of outdoor air pollution. I contributed to a large Health Effects Institute systematic review of traffic-related air pollution and a Dutch Health council advice on ultrafine particles."

Research activity Frédéric Amant heads the Gynecologic Oncology research section at the University of Leuven, Belgium. In 2005 he founded the ESGO taskforce on Cancer in Pregnancy, now the “International Network on Cancer, Infertility and Pregnancy” (INCIP) (www.cancerinpregnancy.org), and chairs this network up till now. The INCIP’s main objective was to create a registry of pregnant cancer patients. The INCIP network now consists of over 86 members from 66 medical centers from over 27 different countries. The design of the INCIP registry allows the collection of retrospective (before 2005) and prospective (from 2005 onward) data, to support studies that are aimed at improving oncological management during pregnancy and obstetric outcome. To our knowledge, the INCIP registry is the largest international registry of patients with cancer diagnosed during pregnancy, with now over 2500 registered patients. Since 2014, INCIP also registers young women who aim to preserve their fertility. In his cancer in pregnancy research, Frédéric Amant mainly focuses on: - Documenting the general well-being, neurological, cardiologic outcome of children after in utero exposure to chemo– and/or radiotherapy. - Pharmacokinetics of chemotherapy during pregnancy and transplacental passage of different drugs. - The prognosis of breast cancer during pregnancy. - Maternal and paternal psychological wellbeing when cancer is diagnosed during pregnancy. - An international registration study with online patient registration to collect oncological, obstetrical and perinatal data on female patients who become pregnant after any type of cancer. In addition, Frédéric Amant founded Trace, the tumor xenograft platform at the KULeuven aiming to bring basic research closer to the clinic. Here, he focuses on better treatment modalities for epithelial and mesenchymal uterine cancers."

My main interest is about brain lesions acquired during the perinatal age and within the big field of perinatal brain damage, the focus of my research has been moving from accuracy of diagnosis, better understanding of pathogenesis and prediction of outcome.In order to investigate the pathogenesis of brain damage, I performed clinical research studies on cerebral haemodynamics using near-infrared spectroscopy in preterm infants. I used brain imaging techniques to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the prediction of prognosis in infants with brain lesions. Starting from cranial ultrasound I moved to conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and advanced MR techniques (DWI, DTI, SWI and volumetric MRI) to study perinatal brain damage and the impact of prematurity, and related diseases, on brain development in preterm infants. A relevant part of my publishing activity comes from the collaboration in the study project: ""Cancer in Pregnancy (CIP-study): long term follow up of children in utero exposed to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy"".

Neurosurgery of Bergamo is the center of reference for the province of Bergamo (about 1 million 200 thousand inhabitants). There are eleven medical consultant and three registrars working there. The unit, which is part of the ""Neuroscience"" Department, consists of thirty inpatient beds. The NeuroIntensive Care Unit and the Post-Operative NeuroIntensive Care Unit include another sixteen beds. There are two operating rooms which are active every day from 8:00 to 19:00. One of the two rooms is also used for emergency / urgent neurosurgery. Every year about 1300 surgeries are performed. The technological equipment of the structure is as follows: a Zeiss Pentero microscope equipped with intraoperative videoangiography, a Zeiss NC4 microscope, a Brainlab neuronavigation system, two SONOPET ultrasonic aspirators, one CUSA ultrasonic aspirator, one MicroDoppler, an endoscopic column with Stortz and Aesculap neuroendoscopes, a stereotactic helmet, eight Anspatch drills. In March 2018 two new operating theatres equipped with an high-field MRI and a multislice CT scan, respectively, were opened. The Department works in close partnership with S.C. ENT for the treatment of tumor diseases of the cranial base, in particular for the execution of surgeries with nasal endoscopy. His experience comprise about 100 cases of Endoscopic Endonasal Skull base tumor removal. His surgical cases as the first operator (1995-2014) include more than 2300 operations; about 1000 operations for cranial diseases (supratentorial, infratentorial, and cranial base tumors, as well as vascular disease cases), and more than 1200 operations concerning the spinal column (more than 100 intradural tumors and over 300 operations for instrumented spinal surgery). He is able to entirely treat vascular disease both in urgent and elective cases (Aneurysms, AVMs, Dural arteriovenous fistulas, Cavernous Hemangiomas), using the aids of the intraoperative videoangiography and the MicroDoppler. In the field of spinal pathology he has extensive experience that has allowed him to perform regular operations for spinal fixation at all levels (occipital-cervical, C1-C2, dorsal and lumbosacral) both via posterior, anterior, and anterolateral approaches, using the instruments and surgical techniques most recently available, in particular the minimally invasive methods (es. MI-TLIF). During this time he has introduced into daily practice surgical stabilization via a percutaneus approach and the balloon kyphoplasty. In the field of degenerative pathology of the spine he is able to perform interventions of prosthesis both for the cervical and the lumbar spine. He routinely performs surgery for the removal of vertebral tumors, intradural and intramedullary with the aid of intraoperative monitoring (MEP, SSEP, D wave). The budget objectives set by the General Management were 99% achieved in 2015, 100% in 2016 and 2917, 95% in 2018.

"4180","Bertolini","Guido","","","45688","Guido Bertolini (Milano, 15/07/1964) è medico ricercatore, dirige il Laboratorio di Epidemiologia Clinica dell’Istituto Mario Negri a Bergamo. Il suo ambito principale di ricerca è quello della valutazione e del miglioramento della qualità dell’assistenza, che ha sviluppato principalmente nel campo della Rianimazione e Terapia Intensiva. Insieme a un gruppo di clinici e ricercatori, ha fondato nel 1991 il gruppo collaborativo GiViTI (Gruppo Italiano per la Valutazione degli Interventi in Terapia Intensiva). Il GiViTI è oggi il più grande gruppo di ricerca collaborativa in Terapia Intensiva esistente al mondo, e rappresenta un riferimento a livello internazionale, tanto che reparti di 6 paesi si sono associati (Cipro, Grecia, Israele, Polonia, Slovenia, Ungheria). In questi anni il GiViTI ha realizzato più di 50 progetti di ricerca indipendenti, che hanno dato un contributo importante alle conoscenze in questo settore. Fra i risultati più eclatanti si può citare un progetto che ha dimostrato l’inefficacia e la pericolosità di un nuovo farmaco per le infezioni gravi, che è stato conseguentemente ritirato dal mercato in tutto il mondo. Tuttavia, il risultato più importante conseguito in questi anni è il documentato miglioramento della qualità dell’assistenza nei reparti italiani. Si può calcolare che nei reparti aderenti da più lungo tempo al GiViTI la mortalità dei pazienti è fino al 10% più bassa che nei reparti che si sono iscritti più recentemente. Questo si traduce in circa 1.000 decessi in meno ogni anno. Il dott. Bertolini è stato relatore a più di 250 congressi e convegni internazionali e nazionali e autore di più di 150 articoli scientifici su riviste internazionali e nazionali."

In 1996 Prof. Possover also performed the first laparoscopic bowel resection for the treatment of rectal endometriosis in Germany; this was followed by the first bladder and ureter resections, as well as the laparoscopic intervention for the treatment of endometriosis of the sciatic nerve for about 15 years. - an area in which Prof. Possover is considered to be the ""worldwide leading expert"". Thus he has not only set ""cornerstones"" in laparocoscopic gynaeco-oncology, but has also moved a ""continuing process"" over the past 20 years in pelvic surgery, which has brought laparoscopic surgery far forward to the field of the pelvic neurosurgery: this way he developed a completely new specialty in medicine, the “neuropelveology"", which field of expertise deals with diagnosis and therapies of pathologies of the pelvic nerves and plexuses. In 2003, he was the first in the world to implant electrodes in a paraplegic patient by laparoscopy to restore leg functions. 2006 he used the same surgical procedure - also called LION procedure - to restore bladder and bowel function in a paraplegic woman. Prof. Possover is Director of The Possover International Medical Center AG in Zurich, Ass.

"4314","Elias J.","Jabbour","","","60469","Dr. Jabbour joined the MD Anderson Cancer Center faculty in 2007 and is currently a Professor of Medicine in the Department of Leukemia. He is actively involved in developmental therapeutics research in leukemia. Over the past 5 years he has assisted in developing chemotherapeutic and biologic agents in leukemias and contributed to the development of others. These include: 1) the Hyper CVAD-ofatumumab regimen in ALL; 2) clofarabine in myeloid malignancies; 3) hypomethylating agents in AML and MDS; 4) Tyrosine kinase therapy in CML; and 5) triple therapy in AML. This research has also provided insight into the biology of leukemias. He has extensively addressed the question of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and to analyze the outcome of these patients. We have identified different mechanisms of resistance and described the clinical significance of them. This has clinical significance in establishing new milestones and leading to personalized therapy. This has tremendous consequences at the scientific and financial levels. He was also actively associated with frontline studies of nilotinib and dasatinib which resulted in FDA approval of these agents for frontline CML therapy in 2010. In addition we have recently addressed the question of genomic instabilities in patients with low-risk MDS who may need earlier therapeutic intervention. This served as a rationale for the first study in the world randomizing such patients to either 5-azacitidine or decitabine. Identifying patients at risk and applying earlier intervention may significantly improve their prognosis. He is leading our efforts to test triple therapy in AML (nucleoside analogs + anthracyclines + cytarabine). The interim results from this randomized trial show a significant improvement in outcome in patients who receive the nucleoside analog clofarabine. This may change the standard of care for the management of patients with AML. Furthermore, I am currently investigating the benefit of adding humanized monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with ALL (ofatumumab and HCVAD) and collaborating in the development of monoclonal antibody studies in adult ALL. Finally, he has authored or co-authored hundreds of peer reviewed medical publications and have served on editorial boards of several scientific journals.

"4344","Federico","Cappuzzo","","","66767","Director and Chief of Division of Medical Oncology 2, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute Personal Statement My interest in the field of medical oncology dates back to the early nineties. In those years, following my graduation in Medicine and Surgery at the University of Palermo, I focused on a postdoctoral fellowship in medical oncology, which I accomplished in 1996 at the University of Milan. Since then, I’ve been strongly committed to gain methodological skills in clinical and translational research and to manage cancer patients in full agreement with the most updated national and international guidelines and according to their individual needs. To these purposes, I further trained as a postdoctoral fellow in Medical Oncology at the National Cancer Institute in Milan. Subsequently, I was awarded with a fellowship on gene therapy of lung cancer at the Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif (Paris). Then, I strengthened my experience in clinical practice and applied the fundamental tenets of cancer research at the Bellaria Hospital in Bologna. I subsequently joined a further postdoctoral program in thoracic oncology at medical University of South Carolina in Charleston (USA). I was then appointed Assistant Professor in Medical Oncology at Istituto Clinico Humanitas IRCCS in Rozzano (Milano), with a special focus in translational research in lung and colorectal cancer. I pursued these same interests while acting as Director of Medical Oncology at the Ospedale Civile in Livorno, wherein I was also appointed Director of the Oncology Department. In Ravenna, I was then appointed Director of Medical Oncology at the Santa Maria delle Croci Hospital in Ravenna. Through the following years, I covered similar tasks while acting as Director of the Department of Oncology and Hematology at the AUSL Romagna. In 2017, I was appointed Full Professor in medical Oncology at the National Level. I then joined the colleagues of the IRCCS Regina Elena Cancer Institute, where I’ve been recently appointed Director of the Division of Medical Oncology 2. Within such a context, my strongest commitments relate to perform clinical and translation research, develop and participate in clinical trials at a national and international level. I’m further committed to take a leadership role in clinical operation, education, and research within the Division of Medical Oncology 2 and to implement and expand these same activities in the frame of multidisciplinary collaborations at the departmental level. Active and scientifically sound collaborations with other national and international Institutions striving for excellence in cancer research and care will also include exchange programs for PhD students and postdoctoral fellows in the field of Medical Oncology.

"4383","Tomasz J.","Guzik","","","","For almost two decades my research has focused on vascular biology, hypertension, and vascular biology. I have employed a combination of molecular biology, physiology, and biochemical approaches to gain insight into the mechanisms of vascular dysfunction and blood pressure regulation. My two most important contributions include studies on reactive oxygen species and vascular dysfunction, and more recently, the investigation of the role of inflammation and adaptive immunity in hypertension. As a clinician-scientist, my focus is to perform translational work characterizing novel mechanisms of vascular disease that are directly relevant to human pathology. My group uses mouse and rat experimental models, cell culture, human blood vessel tissue, and heart studies to achieve this. In my early scientific career, working with Professor Keith Channon in Oxford, I was one of the first to show that NADPH oxidase activity in human vessels alters endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in diabetes and hypertension. I also pioneered the characterization of human NADPH oxidases, and my work has contributed to the understanding of how free radicals may lead to vascular dysfunction in humans. In cooperation with Professor David G. Harrison of Vanderbilt University, my recent work has focused on studying the immune mechanisms that contribute to hypertension. In the past few years, my research has shown that T cells play a critical role in the development of hypertension and my work now largely focuses on understanding the activation and participation of T cells in this disease. I have published over 240 original studies in prestigious journals, including J Exp Med, J Clin Invest, Circulation, Circ Res, JACC and Eur Heart J as well as Hypertension, ATVB, FASEB J as well as the New Engl J Med and Lancet. Of these contributions, 30 papers have been cited more than 100 times. 7 of these papers have a “Highly cited” award from the ISI Web of Science. My most cited first author original contribution has been cited 1045 times. I serve on the editorial boards of several journals including Hypertension, the Eur Heart J. I am currently Editor-in-Chief of Cardiovascular Research and so far led to development of the jour al from Impact Factor of 5.0 to 8.1. I am also a member of the Board of the European Society of Cardiology and Chairperson of the European Society of Cardiology Publications Committee overseeing all ESC publications including Eur Heart J."

My primary areas of interest are AML/MDS. I am currently PI on multiple ongoing clinical trials (majority of these are investigator-initiated studies) including three registrational multinational phase III studies in the Department of Leukemia, MDACC. The majority of these trials are early phase trials in AML focused on developing a personalized therapy approach by targeting specific mutations or immune antigens expressed by patients with AML and MDS and overcoming resistance by applying novel combinations. I have been able to publish >300 peer-reviewed manuscripts, the majority being in the field of novel therapies and combinations in AML. My current clinical research focuses on developing immunotherapeutic approaches for AML/MDS, as well as novel venetoclax combinations in AML by identifying biomarkers of sensitivity/resistance and mechanisms of resistance to venetoclax in combination with hypomethylating agent or with LDAC. These efforts have led to rationally designed phase I/II clinical trials of venetoclax or HMA-venetoclax in combination with second generation FLT3-inhibitors (doublets and triplets with gilteritinib and quizartinib), with MCL-1 inhibitors (S64315), with CD47 antibody magrolimab, with CD123 antibody IMGN632, PD1 inhibitor nivolumab and with idasanutlin (MDM2 inhibitor). I am leading or co-leading these clinical trials at the national/international level including the FLT3-VEN combinations and registrational trials with CD47 antibody magrolimab that have shown great promise. I have a long-standing collaboration with Drs DiNardo, Patel, and Konopleva, and we have co-authored multiple papers and conducted numerous trials together. The proposal to test novel MRD directed combinations in AML is the first of its kind platform and will be a high priority trial for accrual at MDACC and in our AML/MDS clinical trial research group."

His neurology training led him to an interest in brain tumors and he went on to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to work with oncology pioneer, Dr. Emil Freireich, who in the 1960s was the first to use combination chemotherapy to cure childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Dr. Estey worked at MD Anderson for nearly 30 years. He and his family decided to relocate to the Seattle area in 2007 for a change of scenery, and so he could help build an AML program at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Dr. Estey is board certified in internal medicine, hematology and medical oncology. He is a member of the American Society of Hematology, American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Cancer Research."

"4426","Tapan M.","Kadia","","","68049","I am currently faculty in the Department of Leukemia at MD Anderson Cancer Center. In this role, I am directly involved in clinical and translational research, care of leukemia patients in inpatient and outpatient settings, and education of fellows. I work in close collaboration with basic science and clinical faculty to develop hypothesis-driven clinical research. With these collaborations, I have been able to 1) test hypotheses in preclinical systems to serve as the basis for clinical investigations, and 2) to interrogate clinical samples from investigational trials for biological correlatives. I am currently primary investigator in several ongoing clinical trials in acute leukemias and bone marrow failure. In AML, I have developed a low intensity prolonged therapy program for older patients unfit for intensive therapy, as well as a 3-drug intensive induction program for younger patients. Both studies include molecular genetic characterization of the leukemia and targeted therapy for subsets. These serve as the frontline treatment for newly-diagnosed patients in the leukemia department. For highrisk patients who have achieved a remission, I am investigating longer-term maintenance strategies to reduce risk of relapse and improve outcomes. Lenalidomide maintenance investigates the ability of this oral agent to activate NK-cell immunosurveillance after chemotherapy. Nivolumab maintenance investigates the activity of the PD-1 antibody to augment T-cell activity and antitumor immunity in minimal residual disease setting, again to prolong remissions. This is being conducted in collaboration with immune monitoring by the immunotherapy platform at MDACC. For patients with high-risk and relapsed AML, I have developed several developmental therapeutic programs testing scientifically rational compound and combinations in AML, including CDK inhibitors, MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibitors, JAk-STAT inhibitors, and inhibitors of transcription factors. In addition to the AML program, I have developed a program studying bone marrow failure, both by improving response rates to current immunosuppressive therapy protocols, investigating the underlying molecular derangements in these diseases, and developing completely new strategies to modulate the immune microenvironment. To complement my clinical and research activities, I am deeply involved in education and teaching both within the institution as well outside MDACC. I am a departmental representative for the hematology/oncology fellowship steering committee and involved in teaching, both in patient settings as well as during didactic lectures. I am involved in lecturing in the GME curriculum series and am an organizing member of the MDACC Board Review program committee. I am currently the chairman of the Leukemia New Patient Treatment Planning Meeting and involved in departmental and institutional quality improvement initiatives."

"4435","Giovanni","Roti","","","68029","The main focus of my research is to identify new targets and small molecules therapeutics for aggressive leukemia subtypes. These research interests grew out of diverse experiences through my clinical and scientific training. My first exposure to research was during my clinical fellowship in Cristina Mecucci’s laboratory at the University of Perugia in Italy. My efforts focused on the development of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and the identification of NPM1 gene in primary leukemia samples with normal karyotypes. During my tenure in Dr. Mecucci’s laboratory, we extended the DHPLC application beyond leukemia and into the mutational analysis in lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes, and congenital disorders. Because of my commitment to a physician-scientist career I had also been selected to participate, at the same institution, in a competitive Ph.D. program focusing on hematological malignancies and bone marrow transplantation. In 2007, I journeyed to Boston with the support of the EHA-ASH International fellowship and I began working in Dr. Kimberly Stegmaier at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. Dr. Stegmaier gave me the unique opportunity to finish my Ph.D. studies while working as a post-doctoral fellow in her laboratory. My project began with the implementation of Gene expression-based high-throughput screening (GE-HTS) and its application to NOTCH1 mutant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. I performed a small-molecule library screen to identify modulators of mutated NOTCH1 in T-ALL, an effort that resulted in the discovery of a new class of modulators, SERCA inhibitors (e.g. thapsigargin) for this indication. Furthermore over the many years spent at the DFCI, in collaboration with Dr. James Bradner and Jun Qi, we leveraged the aberrant expression of the folic acid receptor in T-ALL and folate receptor-mediated endocytosis to deliver the first in class folate-thapsigargin derivative in vivo for Notch-activated cancer. In 2017 I relocated in Italy and established my laboratory with the support of a competitive grant from the Italian Association of Cancer Research. The initial phase of my research was to extend the studies on SERCA to develop inhibitors with better drug-like properties (Cell Chemical Biology, 2020). More recently I began interested in the intersection of i) transcriptomic and high-throughput phosphoproteomics to identify new target in pediatric cancer such as T-ALL ii) the development of forward screening approaches to identify recurrent pattern of response to drugs in high-risk leukemia patients. At the University of Parma, I have organized a team of highly qualified researchers with international experience who share my passion for basic science, including 2 post-doctoral fellow, 3 PhD students, and a research assistant."

"4648","Michele Carugno","","","","74696","I attended the University of Milan, Italy (UNIMI) Medical School, from which I graduated in 2008. My Residency in Occupational Medicine (UNIMI - 2014) allowed me to deepen my knowledge in Preventive Medicine, Biostatistics, and Epidemiology, in which I gained further expertise through different post-graduate training programs (some of which held by internationally renowned institutions) as well as during my Ph.D. in Epidemiology, Environment and Public Health (UNIMI - 2016). Between 2014 and 2017 I worked at the Dept. of Clinical Sciences and Community Health (DISCCO) of UNIMI as a Research Fellow and, between 2017 and 2018, at the Labour Administration, Labour Inspection and Occupational Safety and Health Branch (LABADMIN/OSH) of the International Labour Organization (ILO - Geneva, Switzerland), first as an Intern in Occupational Health and subsequently as an Occupational Safety and Health Technical Officer. In 2018 I came back to DISCCO - UNIMI, first as an Assistant Professor and, since 2021, as an Associate Professor in Occupational Medicine, in formal agreement with the Occupational Health Unit - Epidemiology Unit of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. My main research focuses on the effects of occupational and environmental exposures in workers, the general population, and susceptible subgroups (e.g., children, subjects affected by obesity), with a particular focus on mechanistic aspects (molecular and epigenetic markers). I am conducting studies on the role of air pollution in influencing psychiatric diseases (in particular, major depressive disorder) and implementing a project aimed to characterize and identify molecular alterations associated with risk factors for lumbar disc herniation. Since 2020, I have been involved in projects investigating the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers and the general population and I coordinated an analysis to evaluate potential associations between air pollution and COVID-19. In the recent past, I have studied the potential effects (and related mechanisms) of night shift work, the influence of hormonal therapies on the risk of lung cancer in women (EAGLE and ILCCO studies) as well as the role of psychosocial factors on the risk of musculoskeletal disorders in different working populations recruited in the CUPID study. I then developed an expertise on the methods of health impact assessment of environmental exposures, with a particular emphasis on air pollution and noise. In 2020, I joined the Network on the Coordination and Harmonisation of European Occupational Cohorts (OMEGA-NET) and the Global Burden of Disease Collaborators. Up to 2022, I kept collaborating with the ILO for the revision and finalization of the “Guidance notes for diagnosis and prevention of the diseases in the ILO list of occupational diseases (revised 2010)”, currently published. Since 2018, I have been teaching courses in Occupational Medicine and Environmental Epidemiology in Medical Schools, Master, and Postgraduate Programs in UNIMI. Since 2019, I have been granted six research projects (funded by UNIMI, CARIPLO Foundation, Italian Ministry of Health, Italian Ministry of University and Research) for a total funding of about 600,000 €, with the role of either principal investigator, coordinator, or referent of a partner unit. In June 2023, I have been awarded the “Antonio Feltrinelli Giovani” prize for Epidemiology from the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei. I authored 62 research papers published in indexed scientific journals (total number of citations: 2,174; average number of citations per publication: 35.1; H-index: 25) and three book chapters. I am member of the Italian Association of Epidemiology (AIE, for which I was elected in the Board of Directors in April 2023), the Italian Society of Occupational Medicine (SIML), the Scientific Committee on Epidemiology in Occupational Health (EPICOH), and the International Society of Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE)"

Academically, Dr. Laghi has been acknowledged by the Italian Minister for University and Research as full professor of gastroenterology in January 2020. He accomplished his fellowships at University of Ann Arbor (MI), directed by Tadakata Yamada, then at University of California San Diego, with Richard Boland. As clinician-scientist he built his CV on biomarkers aimed at improving colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and management. As pivotal experience in Italy, he started and run the Hereditary Cancer Genetics Clinic of the Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, for gastrointestinal tumors. As secretary of the Colorectal Cancer Working Group of Alliance Against Cancer (ACC) funded by the MoH, he recently contributed to launch next generation sequencing programs in the IRCCS foundation, participating to the design of the incoming national program, and currently he is acting as member of the Gersom project steering committee and of the related tumor molecular board. As translational clinician-scientist, Dr. Laghi initially worked on the detection of the polyoma virus JC (JCV) in CRC tissues under the mentorship of Prof. V Neel and Prof. CR Boland, at UM and UCSD. He found T antigen DNA sequences of JCV in the mucosa of normal human colons, CRCs, and CRC xenografts raised in nude mice, and in the human colon cancer cells. He demonstrated that the negatively supercoiled JCV, in the human tissues, can be easily detected by the treatment with topoisomerase I. His results indicate that JCV DNA can be found in colonic tissues, which raises the possibility that this virus may play a role in the chromosomal instability observed in colorectal carcinogenesis. While working with Prof. Boland, Dr. Laghi did not neglect the molecular basis of inherited CRC, with emphasis on Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer in the setting of deficient DNA mismatch repair (or Lynch syndrome). Dr. Laghi collected one of the largest mono-institutional series of CRC in Europe, addressing inherited CRC and the underlying types of genomic instability, chiefly mismatch repair defects. Dr. Laghi focused his scientific work in the field of Microsatellite Instability (MSI), demonstrating that MSI is a stage-dependent predictor of survival in patients with colorectal cancer and that the decreased likelihood of metastases in patients with MSI cancer is associated with specific genetic and epigenetic changes of the primary tumor. Thereafter, he included in his translational studies the density of tumor infiltrating immune cells as non-clonal determinants of patient prognosis. He found that metachronous metastases are unlikely to arise from node-negative (i.e., stage II) CRCs with a high-density CD3+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), whereas high densities of CD3+ TILs are not associated with the absence of postsurgical metastasis in patients with node-positive colorectal cancer (stage III). These data suggest that densities of CD3+ TILs cannot be used as an independent predictor of clinical outcome in patients with stage III colorectal cancer and, at least for now, the tumor-node-metastasis classification should remain the preferred prognostic system. These findings are consistent with a relationship between nodal involvement and tumor immune-evasion. He replicated these findings in other independent papers concerning other immune-cell populations (published and unpublished results). Currently, new interesting results in this field concern the identification of immune populations of macrophages the density of which can predict the responsiveness to chemotherapy. In parallel, looking for innovative CRC biomarkers in the peritumoral stroma, led Dr. Laghi to test this heterogeneous milieu for the presence of non-canonical neoplastic cells possibly exploiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to invade the nearby tissues. His team first demonstrated that the peritumoral stroma of CRC harbors tumor cells in mesenchymal disguise, sharing the same genetic abnormalities of cancer cells. Moving from this finding, his group also showed that EMT factors can be detected in the blood of CRC patients and is actively working on this issue as a diagnostic and possibly prognostic tool in CRC and pancreatic cancer (Patent. European Patent Office, Application No. 13197367.9-1403). As a clinician, he has both degrees in Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, and has taken care of out-patients as well as of in-patients for more than 20 years, being actively involved in the management of clinical cases at the Humanitas Research Hospital. Besides varying clinical duties, he run practice dedicated to the recognition of inherited predisposition to gastrointestinal cancers and to the risk management of developing colorectal and pancreas cancer. He transferred this expertise in the Emilia district, starting a similar program within the AOU of Parma. He serves as a reviewer for major international journals, spanning clinical and translational research, such as Gastroenterology, Gut, Cancer Research, Clinical Cancer Research, Cancer Immunology Research.

"4761","Ajay Goel","","","","70212","The overarching focus of my research is on molecular diagnostics, therapeutics, and translational aspects of cancer, with a specific focus on gastrointestinal cancers. After my faculty appointment at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, CA, in 2001, I began to develop my research interests around gaining a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of cancer pathogenesis. After joining Baylor Scott & White Research Institute (BSWRI), Dallas, TX, in 2003, I established my own independent research program on cancer epigenetics, prevention, and translational oncology. In 2019, I relocated my research team to the Beckman Research Institute (BRI) at City of Hope, Duarte, CA, where I serve as a Professor and the founding Chair of the Department of Molecular Diagnostics and Experimental Therapeutics, as well as Associate Director of Basic Science of the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COHCCC). Over more than two decades, I have successfully developed and led several multi-national research collaborations with various nationally and internationally recognized scientists within the U.S. (e.g., from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, UCSD, Mayo Clinic, University of Illinois at Chicago, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and MD Anderson Cancer Center), as well as from Japan, China, South Korea, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Australia, and Argentina. This has resulted in the publication of >375 peer-reviewed research articles in leading oncology and gastroenterology-related international journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Science Translational Medicine, Nature Reviews, Nature Communications, Lancet Oncology, JAMA Network Open, Gastroenterology, Cancer Research, Clinical Cancer Research, JCO Precision Oncology, and Journal of the National Cancer Institute, with a corresponding h-index of 96 and an i10-index of 278. In addition, I have more than 45 patents granted or applications in review, and numerous domestic and international invited professorships and invited presentations. During the past 20+ years, my research efforts have been continuously supported by intramural and extramural funding from the National Cancer Institute, NIH, and private foundations and agencies, as an independent PI or co-investigator. The success of our research endeavors in developing non-invasive, liquid biopsy-based diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers for various gastrointestinal cancers, specifically colorectal and pancreatic cancers, has been largely due to my ability to foster more than 100 collaborations with key laboratories worldwide, as well as in establishing a unique, one-of-a-kind biorepository with thousands of clinically annotated tissue and blood plasma and serum specimens. Moreover, our track record of finishing projects, publishing extensively in the leading cancer and gastroenterology-related journals, and the availability of comprehensive laboratory resources to us at our institution all contribute to our success. Taken together, my past success, academic accomplishments, and scientific productivity in the areas of gastrointestinal cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, cancer genomics, and epigenomics uniquely position me to serve as the PI of this R01 proposal aimed to develop clinically relevant biomarkers for colorectal cancer."

"4776","Matthew Boland Yurgelun","","","","70229","I am a Senior Physician in Medical Oncology at DFCI, an Associate Physician in Medical Oncology at BWH and an Assistant Professor of Medicine at HMS in the Clinical Innovator & Clinical Expert career path. I specialize in and devote most of my time to the care of patients with GI malignancies and patients with inherited predisposition to GI cancers. I also serve as the inaugural Director of the DFCI Lynch Syndrome Center and as Director of Clinical Research for the DFCI Division of Cancer Genetics and Prevention. The rest of my time is devoted to GI cancer genetics clinical research and teaching. I provide ambulatory care in the DFCI GI Cancer Center 1.5 days per week and in the DFCI Cancer Genetics and Prevention Clinic 1 day per week. I also provide inpatient care in Medical Oncology at BWH 2-4 weeks per year and the Gastrointestinal Oncology Consult Service 2-4 weeks per year. My clinical innovations include: (1) leadership of a DFCI initiative and participation in multiple national guideline committees regarding systematic hereditary cancer risk assessment for all patients with pancreatic cancer; and (2) directorship of the first and only multidisciplinary center in the United States dedicated to the care of individuals and families with Lynch Syndrome. I am the DFCI representative to both the NCCN Colorectal Cancer Genetics and Breast/Ovarian/Pancreatic Cancer Genetics Clinical Practice Guidelines Panels and have served on multiple ASCO committees, including the Cancer Prevention Committee and the Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee. I co-authored an ASCO Provisional Clinical Opinion on the identification of patients with inherited pancreatic cancer risk (Stoffel EM, et al. J Clin Oncol 2019) as well as multiple other editorials related to hereditary cancer risk assessment and management (Yurgelun MB, et al. Cell 2017; Yurgelun MB. J Clin Oncol 2017; Yurgelun MB and Kastrinos F. J Clin Oncol 2019; Yurgelun MB and Chan AT. Lancet 2020). I have been invited to lecture and serve as an expert discussant on hereditary GI cancer at the 2015, 2017-19, and 2021 ASCO Annual Meetings and to be a speaker/panelist and session moderator at the 2016 and 2017 DDW meetings. I have presented original research at the CGA-ICC annual meeting for 11 consecutive years, including numerous plenary session oral presentations. These projects led to multiple first-author publications, three of which are cited by the NCCN Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer High-Risk Assessment. After serving a three-year term as an elected member of the CGA-IGC Leadership Council, I was elected to serve as the society’s national President for the 2019-20 term. I was PI on projects studying multigene panel testing in patients with suspected Lynch syndrome (2014 ASCO Annual Meeting oral abstract; Gastroenterology, 2015) and in unselected patients with colorectal cancer (2016 ASCO Annual Meeting oral abstract; J Clin Oncol, 2017). In July 2016, I was awarded grants by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center GI Cancer SPORE and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Medical Oncology Translational Grant Program to study the implementation of universal hereditary cancer risk assessment for patients with pancreatic cancer. I have been invited to present my research at the Yale University School of Medicine GI Section’s research conference series (March 2016) the Jefferson University Hospital’s Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Grand Rounds (February 2017), and the University of Rochester’s Wilmot Cancer Institute (June 2017). Over the past three years, I have given more than 20 lectures locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally on my work in inherited gastrointestinal cancer genetics. Most recently, I submitted an R01 grant application to the NCI in October 2021 proposing to study a novel form of communicating personalized inherited cancer risk estimates in individuals with Lynch syndrome. I have been involved with various patient-facing efforts regarding inherited cancer risk. I have co-led the DFCI LYNKED IN Lynch syndrome patient and family conference for the past 4 years, including the 2021 conference which was attended by Lynch syndrome patients from 33 U.S. states and 18 countries. I was also invited to give a keynote talk at the 2021 Facing Our Risk for Cancer Empowered (FORCE) hereditary cancer patient advocacy conference and was elected to serve on the FORCE Board of Directors in 2021. Regarding teaching, in addition to my supervisory roles with Fellows and Residents in the ambulatory setting and with Physician Assistants and Internal Medicine Housestaff in inpatient care, I have mentored multiple trainees in clinical cancer genetics research over the past three years, including Dr. Leah Biller who was recently hired to the DFCI faculty as well as Dr. Connie Zhong, a resident in the Harvard Combined Dermatology Program. I have also given lectures to trainees of various levels at DFCI, BWH, and HMS on a spectrum of topics related to gastrointestinal oncology and inherited cancer risk.

He is current the deputy director of Department of Medical Research in NTUH, with the responsibilities of clinical trials, real-world evidence, and big data science. The overriding theme throughout his researches is the gastric cancer screening and prevention, with emphasis on the elucidation of disease natural course, risk factor identification, and the design, implementation, and evaluation of the preventive programs. For example, Helicobacter pylori is the primary cause of stomach cancer; however, acceptance of the hypothesis that eradication of H. pylori could both prevent and reduce the incidence of stomach cancer is slow. It is because there is lacking of evidences concerning the long-term benefits and risks. Another obstacle is the lack of methods to implement this strategy on a policy level. Dr. Lee’s major achievement is the design of the stomach cancer prevention program by answering the questions about whether it is preventable and if so, how to implement the program. Novel approaches have been developed, including the mass eradication method, the two-in-one method, and the index case method, tailored to the population differences in the cancer risk, environment, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and health care resource. Not only confirmed the long-term benefits, several theoretical risks of adverse consequences were elucidated. As a result, this healthcare strategy has demonstrated successful multi-location rollout in Taiwan, which is accompanied by the reduction in stomach cancer incidence."

Since 2013 our group is recruiting study subjects to the population-based, randomised gastric cancer prevention study GISTAR (www.gistar.eu), the only of its type in Europe. The protocol of the study was designed by involving the globally leading specialists in epidemiology research from Sweden, France (IARC), The Netherlands, USA. Further analysis to be conducted on the GISTAR participants (currently>10,000 subjects recruited) will be an integral part of the current project.

"5083","Abigail Raffner","Basson","","","72756","My name is Abigail Raffner Basson (PhD, RD, LD), and I am a KO1-funded Instructor of Research in the Division of Gastroenterology and the Digestive Health Research Institute (DHRI) at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). My research goal is to identify mechanisms for targeted dietary manipulation of intestinal microbiota and inflammation that can be used as predictors or therapeutic modifiers of disease severity in patients affected with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, especially Crohn’s disease (CD). As such, my research integrates basic science and translational clinical research in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), combining clinical nutrition and translational bioinformatic methodologies to identify candidate dietary nutrients that will ultimately be translated to biomarkers associated with ‘person-specific’ therapeutic strategies. Since joining the Division of Gastroenterology my research has focused on defining the relevance of mouse models of intestinal inflammation relevant to CD and ulcerative colitis, and determining the impact of nutrition and diet in IBD. Specifically, I have developed and validated a human gut microbiota transplantation mouse model of IBD, and used this biologically relevant tool to test the microbiota-mediated effect of dietary substrates on human gut communities. On the clinical component, I have focused on implementing IRB-approved strategies to validate the findings derived from my mouse work and am currently the PI of an NIH-funded diet intervention study (NCT04065048) in patients at the Digestive Health Institute at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. I have 13 years of experience as a clinical dietitian, including 9 years of IBD-focused clinical research, and have mentored over 100 students both within the hospital and the university research setting. My diverse clinical and basic science training and research experience in nutrition, IBD, and nutrigenomics, and my cumulative teaching and mentoring experience have placed me in a unique position to pursue my research through extramurally funded research opportunities and to serve as a valuable collaborator both on a national and international level."

"5206","Masashi Yanagisawa","","","","73367","In 1988, as a graduate student at University of Tsukuba, Yanagisawa discovered endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor peptide from vascular endothelial cells, which sparked an intense research activity in the field. In the subsequent year, his group identified a G protein-coupled receptor for endothelin, which would become an important drug target; the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan was approved in 2001 for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. After moving to University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas in 1991 as a young principal investigator, he identified the endothelin-converting enzyme, a metalloprotease that generate the active, mature endothelin peptides. Through gene-targeting experiments in mice, he also discovered in 1994 that the endothelin pathway is essential for embryonic development of certain neural crest derived tissues, and that endothelin-B receptor deficiency causes Hirschsprung disease in mice and humans. In 1996, he initiated a systematic search for endogenous ligands of “orphan” G protein-coupled receptors, which resulted in his 1998 discovery of orexin, a hypothalamic neuropeptide. He then discovered in 1999 that orexin deficiency causes the sleep disorder narcolepsy. This opened up a new avenue in sleep research, and led to a better understanding of sleep/wake switching mechanisms in the brain. The notion that orexin is an important endogenous waking agent led to the development of orexin receptor antagonists as sleep-inducing drug, first of which, suvorexant, was approved in 2014. Recognizing, however, that the fundamental mechanism for sleep homeostasis still remains a mystery, in 2010 he embarked upon a highly ambitious project of polysomnography (EEG/EMG)-based forward genetic screen for sleep/wake abnormalities in chemically mutagenized mouse cohort. This large-scale project is now continuing in Tsukuba, Japan, and has recently led to identification of several new genes and molecular pathways that are importantly involved in the regulation of sleep amounts and the level of sleep need."

"5283","Giuseppe Daniele","","","","73675","Current Position:Associate Professor, SSD MED/13 “Endocrinologia” Scientific Profile: in the last ten years the scientific activity has focused on the study of the role of central nervous system on energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. To this aim the clinical activity has been constantly combined with basic and clinical research. Clinical activity is carried out in diabetes clinics in Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana in Pisa and is aimed at the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of all forms of diabetes and complications. A dedicated laboratory equipped to perform experiments on cell lines, animal models and in humans in vivo was founded in 2016-2018 and associated to a complex collaboration network. The current clinical research activity is equipped with the following methodologies for the study of energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism: clamp techniques, mixed meal test combined radioisotope turnover technology (glucose and glycerol stable isotopes), indirect and direct calorimetry. Based on the close integration between clinical activity and clinical research, the research group has received numerous grants for the development of clinical pharmacological trials that have allowed to explore the impact on in vivo glucose metabolism and brain functions of type 2 diabetes drugs such as GLP-1 analogues, SGLT-inhibitors and others. Moreover, thanks to a large funding from the Center for Instrument Sharing of the University of Pisa (CISUP), in 2021 our laboratory has been equipped with an instrumentation consisting of a high-density EEG, fNIRS, brain plasticity apparatus and transcranial magnetic stimulator. This instrumentation allows to study and modulate in real time the central nervous system and explore the impact of diabetes in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in a multiparametric way. To this innovative laboratory was given the acronym PIANOLA that stands for Perturbational NeurolLab. Recently our research group participated to Bando Ricerca Salute 2018 of Regione Toscana in Italy with the project entitled PREMED-2: Precision medicine for preventing type 2 diabetes: a step forward, which was funded, and aim is to identify the population of subjects at risk of developing type 2 diabetes based on an opportunistic approach."

La Prof.ssa Simonelli è Responsabile Scientifico di numerosi progetti di ricerca nazionali ed internazionali, nonché principale investigatore di numerosi trial clinici multicentrici internazionali. Nel Dicembre 2017 la Prof.ssa Simonelli ha ricevuto la Renato Frezzotti SOI Medal da parte della Società Oftalmologica Italiana per la sua attività di ricerca nell’ambito della terapia genica oculare. Nel corso della sua carriera ha ricevuto numerosi altri premi nazionali ed internazionali per la sua attività di ricerca, tra i quali il Premio della Fondazione Americana Foundation Fighting Blindness per il suo contributo nello sviluppo della terapia genica oculare. La Prof.ssa Simonelli, inoltre, è Presidente della Società Italiana di Oftalmologia Genetica (SIOG); Presidente del Comitato Scientifico di Retina Italia Onlus; Componente del Comitato tecnico nazionale per la prevenzione della cecità del Ministero della Salute; Componente del Tavolo Tecnico Malattie Rare della Regione Campania Infine, la Prof.ssa Simonelli è revisore o membro del comitato editoriale di numerose riviste scientifiche internazionali. L’attività di ricerca della Prof.ssa Simonelli ha riguardato inizialmente lo studio dei possibili meccanismi coinvolti nella patogenesi della cataratta. Successivamente, l’attività di ricerca ha riguardato gli aspetti clinici e genetici delle degenerazioni retiniche ereditarie, grazie a collaborazioni con biologi molecolari e genetisti nazionali ed internazionali. Inizialmente, tale attività mirava a scoprire geni causa di malattia e a correlarli alle diverse forme cliniche, conseguendo risultati che hanno inciso nella definizione delle attuali classificazioni delle malattie. Da questo lavoro clinico-genetico si è riusciti a definire ampie casistiche italiane di degenerazioni retiniche ereditarie, quali la Retinite Pigmentosa, l’Amaurosi Congenita di Leber, malattie molto gravi ed invalidanti che portano alla cecità e all’ipovisione, nei casi più gravi, anche nella prima infanzia. Sino a qualche decennio fa, per queste malattie non esistevano prospettive di cure. Per questo, il passo successivo è stato quello di avviare un lavoro preclinico con biologi molecolari, genetisti, veterinari in modelli animali di degenerazioni retiniche ereditarie volto a verificare la possibilità di curare tali malattie con la terapia genica. Gli approcci di terapia genica mirano a sostituire il gene malato con la copia corretta inserita in vettori virali ed introdotti nella retina. Questo lavoro è proseguito con successo ed ha portato, circa 15 anni fa, ad effettuare il primo trial clinico al mondo di terapia genica per una malattia oculare, in tre pazienti italiani affetti da Amaurosi Congenita di Leber, diagnosticati ed individuati dalla prof.ssa Francesca Simonelli. La sperimentazione, grazie alla collaborazione con Colleghi dell’Istituto Tigem di Napoli e del Children Hospital di Philadelphia. è proseguita con successo fino ad arrivare all’approvazione della terapia, con il nome commerciale di Luxturna, nell’ottobre del 2017. Dopo l’approvazione, la Prof.ssa Simonelli e il suo team hanno potuto trattare con il farmaco Luxturna diciotto pazienti, di cui dieci in età pediatrica, affetti da Amaurosi Congenita di Leber, offrendo loro la possibilità di recuperare la capacità visiva. Il successo della terapia genica ha portato ad allargarne l’applicazione anche ad altre degenerazioni retiniche ereditarie, come la Malattia di Stargardt, la Retinite Pigmentosa, la Sindrome di Usher, progetti in cui attualmente la Prof.ssa Francesca Simonelli continua l’attività di ricerca con il coinvolgimento in trials clinici in pazienti."

Originally from the US, he received his bachelors in Psychology in 1983 from The American University in Washington, DC, then his PhD in Neuroscience in 1990 from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC Canada. He did a 2-year postdoctoral fellowship in molecular neurobiology in the laboratory of Dr. Donald Pfaff at Rockefeller University in New York City, after which he became a Professor of Neuroscience in the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology, Department of Psychology, at Concordia University in Montréal, Canada from 1992 to 2018. He left Concordia in 2018 and was a visiting researcher at the Universidad Veracruzana in Xalapa with colleagues in the Instituto de Investigaciones Cerebrales from 2019 to 2021, after which he moved to Prague in the Czech Republic to become a Professor of Neuroscience at Charles University and Research Director at the Center for Sexual Health and Intervention, where his laboratory is located. Jim’s research uses both rats and humans to understand how the brain and its neurochemical and neuroendocrine systems are organized for basic sexual responses like arousal, desire, sexual pleasure and orgasm, and sexual inhibition and disgust. His work has also shed light on the neural and molecular mechanisms by which conditioned sexual responses potentiate sexual preferences and reproduction, and how they figure in the development of fetishes and paraphilias. He has published over 250 peer-reviewed scientific papers and book chapters on the neurobiology of sexual behavior in both females and males, and his work has led to the formulation of new drugs to treat sexual dysfunctions and ways to compensate for psychiatric medications that have debilitating sexual side effects. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the journal Current Sexual Health Reports, Associate editor of Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, past associate editor of Sexual Medicine Reviews, and the Journal of Sexual Medicine, and sits on the editorial boards of other scientific journals in sexuality, neuroscience, and pharmacology. He is a Fellow of the International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health and a Past President of the International Academy of Sex Research."

Over the course of the past years, I have been privileged to work on several multi-center pharmacoepidemiology studies using different Italian claims and general practice databases. In particular, I worked on a multi-center project funded by the Italian Health Ministry, aimed at evaluating the prescribing pattern, effectiveness and safety of some first generation biologics, including biosimilars (e.g. erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, somatropin), through a network of claims databases from different Italian regions and cities. Then, I have been actively involved in the coordination of an Italian multi-regional project, known as the VALORE project, funded by the Italian Drug Agency (AIFA); it is aimed at evaluating the comparative post-marketing benefit-risk profile of biological drugs, both originators and biosimilars, in dermatology, rheumatology, gastroenterology and onco-hematology, using real world data from an Italian network of claims databases, active surveillance and clinical registries. I have also coordinated several observational studies funded by pharmaceutical companies, including: studies on the pattern of anti-osteoporosis drugs, antidiabetic drugs or new oral anticoagulants use, using two claims databases of Caserta and Palermo Local Health Units (Southern Italy); a multi-center pharmacoutilization study in collaboration with the University of Bremen (Germany) and with PHARMO Institute for Drug Outcomes Research (Netherlands), aimed at exploring the real world use of biologics for the treatment of colorectal cancer patients. I have been also a Visiting Research Fellow/Collaborator in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

"5401","Esi","Domi","","","","My scientific activity focuses on the study of drugs of abuse, especially on alcohol use disorders. The aim of my current research is to identify neural circuits and molecular level mechanisms of compulsive alcohol taking, a key feature in the diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorders. A solid training in behavioral pharmacology, achieved during my PhD in the laboratory of Professor Roberto Ciccocioppo (University of Camerino, Italy) allowed me to establish several collaborations with important biopharmaceutical companies such as OMEROS and CERECOR INC and. The objective of these collaborations was identifying and validating new therapeutical targets to treat alcohol use disorders. I explored the role opioid receptor  in excessive drinking induced by stress and nicotine, promoting antagonists such as CERC-501 in phase 2 of clinical trials for treatment of alcohol use disorders. Moreover, I explored the role of the nuclear receptor PPARin alcohol use and anxiety disorders elicited by stress or nicotine withdrawal. During my Postdoc, I established a new line of research in the laboratory of Professor Markus Heilig (University of Linköping, Sweden) focusing on the role of individual differences in the vulnerability to develop alcohol addiction. I experienced interdisciplinary approaches applying cutting edge molecular techniques (viral-TRAP approach, DREADDs, NanoString technology, RNAscope) making a step forward in the discovery of molecules that might represent key targets for treating alcohol addiction. Recent findings of my research showing that PKC-δ-positive GABA-ergic neurons in the central amygdala were strongly activated in conjunction with compulsive drinking prompted us to create in collaboration with genOway the first transgenic rat model PKC-δ Cre knock-in. This transgenic line will be strategically used to investigate the role of PKC-δ circuitry in alcohol use disorders. Moreover, Prkcd-Cre Knock-in rats represent a valid genetic tool to investigate the properties and the function of PKCδ+ neurons as well as cell-type specific manipulations of PKCδ+ neuronal circuitry in a range of behavioral models in rats. Findings from my research activity have resulted in 11 first and 16 co-authored publications in highly prestigious journals including Science, Science Advances, Biological Psychiatry, Journal Neuroscience, etc. As a young scientist I had the opportunity to obtain research fundings from LIONS’ postdoc grant from the Center for Systems Neurobiology, Linköping University on the study of the brain networks and molecular mechanisms that drive compulsive-like behavior in alcohol use disorders. Recently, I obtained a research position at the department of Pharmacology and Experimental Medicine that will allow me to further explore the role of individual variability and sex differences in developing excessive alcohol use with the aim to increase the predictive power for a translational research and advance the discovery of novel effective pharmacotherapies in alcohol use disorders."

"5443","Benjamin Barratt","","","","74694","Professor Ben Barratt is a Professor in Environmental Exposures & Public Health and Deputy Director of the Environmental Research Group. The early part of his career focused on the establishment of co-ordinated air quality monitoring networks, including the London Air Quality Network, which became the largest urban network in Europe. He has since utilised this foundation in measurement techniques and data handling to develop analysis methods to characterise sources, trends and behaviour in urban air pollution. He specialised in the evaluation of technological or policy driven initiatives to improve air quality, including the London Congestion Charging Scheme and Low Emission Zone, the outputs of which have been used as evidence for future national and international schemes. The aim of more recent research is to improve the resolution of environmental exposure assessments for panel, cohort and large-scale population studies. This is linked to the development of tools to allow the public to make informed choices to reduce their own exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution. His research is often in collaboration with international multidisciplinary teams ranging from toxicology and population health through to behavioural science and policy development. He is head of the Exposure Science Team, currently comprising five research associates, two research assistants and up to six PhD students. The overarching aim of his team’s work is to better characterise individual and population-level exposure to environmental stress, how this relates to the health of susceptible population subgroups, and methods of public health improvement. Much of the focus of the teams work is on global air quality, primarily in China and Sub-Saharan Africa."

"5561","Dennis","Thomas","","","75423","CAREER SUMMARY: Dr Thomas is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Hunter Medical Research Institute (HMRI), University of Newcastle (UoN). He is a mid-career researcher and an experienced clinical trialist with over 14 years of experience in designing and managing clinical trials. He completed his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Pharmacy from Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, India. He worked in the pharmaceutical industry for almost five years as a Clinical Research Manager and acquired extensive skills and experience in clinical research (involved in 8 industry RCTs) in designing, conducting, evaluating, and communicating clinical trials. Then, he enrolled and completed a PhD program on ‘System change interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalised patients’ at Monash University, Australia, which comprised a Cochrane review, a large multi-centre RCT and development and psychometric validation of Challenges to Stopping Smoking (CSS-21) scale. Additionally, he also completed a Health Economic Analysis module from Monash University and a Professional Diploma in Clinical Research from Catalyst Clinical Service Pvt Ltd, India. He also obtained a Certified Clinical Research Associate credential (in 2010) from the Association of Clinical Research Professionals, USA. After submitting PhD, he joined as a Clinical Trial Coordinator on an NHMRC-funded smoking cessation RCT (n=1,452) comparing cytisine vs varenicline at the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, the University of New South Wales. After completing the RCT, he joined UoN. CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD OF REASERCH: Dr Thomas has published >40 peer-reviewed articles and some in high-impact journals including, the Lancet, JAMA, ERJ, Chest, Cochrane Database Syst Rev and Addition. He has completed 5 Australian-based RCTs from inception to completion. He is currently involved in 3 other RCTs. Dr Thomas led the study design and implementation of Australia’s largest phase 3 smoking cessation tele-trial. Dr Thomas also contributed to multiple Cochrane reviews in the area of tobacco smoking and COPD. His recent work includes exploring remission as a new therapeutic goal for the treatment of asthma and developing and evaluating digital asthma care interventions. He is currently leading a large tele-trial aimed at developing and evaluating a comprehensive national digital asthma care program in collaboration with Asthma Australia. Dr Thomas also worked and published in the area of oral corticosteroid and antibiotic stewardship in severe asthma. Dr Thomas attracted $7.5 million NHMRC research funding as a chief investigator and $2 million as an associate investigator. He also attracted more than $2 million in other research grants. RESEARCH TRANSLATION & PROFESSIONAL INVOLVEMENT: Recently, asthma remission, digital asthma care and oral corticosteroid stewardship have gained much attention among the research community, and Dr Thomas’s work enlightened these important therapeutical concepts. Dr Thomas was instrumental in conceptualising and advancing the remission concept in severe asthma, and led the pioneering review in this area, which provided insights into how remission can be achieved in the current scenario. He also published the possibility of achieving remission using mepolizumab, omalizumab and azithromycin. His cytisine RCT showed the potential of cytisine in smoking cessation therapy, and now the drug is under consideration by the TGA and the US FDA. Dr Thomas is a member of the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, European Respiratory Society, Australian CT Alliance, Society for Research on Nicotine & Tobacco, Cochrane Tobacco Addition Group, Cochrane Airways Group and Indian Pharmaceutical Association. He also contributes to the TGA guideline development panel. SUPERVISION/MENTORING: Dr Thomas has supervised many research staff during his previous appointments, and is currently supervising three research staff, two respiratory physicians, a statistician, a post-doctoral research fellow and a PhD scholar."

The primary goal of his lab is to create and combine tools from neurogenetics/genomics (PMIDs:33558758 [Nature Genetics 2021], 33514395 [Genome Biology 2021], and 33627474 [Genome Research 2021]), artificial intelligence (PMID:35411337 [Nature Machine Intelligence 2022]), electronic health records (EHRs, 100 million electronic patient records, PMID:32984792 [Lancet Digital Health 2020]), systems pharmacology (PMIDs:35572351 [Nature Aging 2021], 31375661, 30002366 and 30867426 [Nature Communications 2018, 2019a and 2019b]), and experimental network biology assays (PMID:36217030 [Nature Biotechnology 2023]), to address the challenging questions toward better understanding of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other AD-related dementia (ADRD), which could have a major impact in identifying real-world big data-driven diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision medicine and drug discovery in neurodegenerative diseases (PMIDs:36450252 [Cell Reports 2022], 33852912 [Cell 2021], 36331056 & 36254161 [Alzheimer's & Dementia 2022a and 2022b], and 30988527 [Nature Neuroscience 2019]). Dr. Cheng has played multiple roles in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) through applying machine learning and systems pharmacology approaches to identify drug targets and risk genes or networks for AD/ADRD form large-scale whole-genome/exome sequencing data and patient clinical databases. He has created multiple network systems medicine methodologies and successfully applied them for Alzheimer’s disease drug discovery: (1) in silico network medicine-based discovery combined with insurance records data mining and patient iPSC-derived neuron models identifies sildenafil (Viagra) as a candidate drug for Alzheimer’s disease (Nature Aging 2021, PMID:35572351) and a Phase II trial has been initialized; (2) multimodal singlecell/nucleus transcriptomics analysis combined with insurance records data mining identifies fluticasone and mometasone (approved asthma drugs) as candidate treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (Genome Research 2021, PMID:33627474); (3) insurance records data mining combined with mouse models identifies salsalate and diflunisal as candidate treatments for Alzheimer’s disease via reducing acetylated tau (Cell 2021, PMID:33852912); and (4) AI/ML-based multimodal analysis of genetic and genomic combined with EHR data identified pioglitazone (Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy 2022, PMID:35012639) and gemfibrozil (Cell Reports 2022, PMID:36450252) as candidate drugs for AD, and further identified Telmisartan as a potential treatment for African Americans with AD (Alzheimer and Dementia 2022, PMID: 36331056). Along with the research background described above, he has gained the necessary leadership and mentorship experience that will be essential for the success training the next generation of scientists and physicians. Through the leadership position at the Molecular Medicine PhD program (Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of CWRU), he is co-developing strategies and mentor PhD students. Moreover, his laboratory has extensive experience with multi-PI grants (including both U01 and R01s with ~$30 millions in the past 5 years as contact PI/m-PI). He has served as a mentor on the 2021 HHMI Gilliam Graduate Mentor Award (mentor graduate students under-represented science background). Overall, Dr. Cheng has mentored or is currently mentoring two MD students, 3 PhD students, and 15 post-doctoral fellows. An emerging area of his Neurodegenerative Medicine Discovery Laboratory is focused on developing cutting edge experimental systems biology (iPSC and brain organoids) and multi-omics technologies to identify novel drug targets and candidate treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases."

"5666","Andrea","Baragetti","","","75886","The research activity is aimed at the study of molecular aspects in cardio-immuno-metabolic diseases, with the aim of proposing potential pharmacological targets. Three themes, developed in detail, make up this general idea: • Understanding the role of the innate immune response in the development of metabolic alterations induced by dyslipidemia. Objectives: To study the activity of the innate immune component in response to metabolic alterations induced by dietary fats. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which the innate immune response reprograms its immune competencies to address, in the long term, the chronic effects of metabolic alterations. • Study of the gut-liver-marrow axis in dyslipidemias Objective: To identify the molecular mechanisms that explain the inflammatory consequences of the metabolic response to lipid (""post-prandial"") nutritional stimuli. To translate these aspects to humans, identifying new potential markers/targets for hypertriglyceridemia and mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia. • Identification of new markers for the personalization of cardiovascular risk stratification Objective: To identify clusters of molecular, genomic, epigenomic, metagenomic and vascular markers of clinical interest to optimize the risk stratification of atherosclerotic and metabolic diseases. This activity is possible thanks to the development of expertise in developing artificial intelligence basedprediction models and the collaboration with clinical centers, epidemiological studies that allow the achievement of biobanks, genetic/clinical/translational data, imaging and in vivo experimental protocols."

"5671","Laure","Elens","","","75891","I started my researches in the field of pharmacogenetics of immunosuppressive treatments 15 years ago, during my master degree (2005-2006). My master project has made my passion for drug PK instinctive. I was interested in understanding the factors that make tacrolimus to accumulate considerably in the hepatic tissue of some patients whereas it was cleared rapidly in others; therefore, affecting the individual therapeutic response to the drug. These achievements made me wanted to extend my knowledge to other drugs and other body compartments. Mainly, when I started my PhD, exploring anti-HIV drugs and their accumulation in PBMCs was my next target. Along the years, I saw the PK world around me evolving from a descriptive and explanatory tool towards a predictive modelling patientcentred method and I got the feeling that I had also to progress. After my postdoctoral stay in Rotterdam (2010-2012), my subsequent personal defy was thus to build a new research group to reach my ambitions. Since 2013, my team, the integrated Pharmacometrics, Pharmacogenetics, Pharmacokinetcs [PMGK] research group, is working on different projects combining clinical, experimental, cellular and molecular approaches to understand the diversity of pharmacological responses. In this framework, my ambition is now to initiate a new horizon in pharmacotherapy integrating host factors in complex models to predict drug metabolism and response to therapy. My current desire is to develop an original novel approach that will combine multiple ground-breaking methods into an integrated pioneering concept aiming at predicting and understanding the PK behavior of drugs and its link with the pharmacological response for a better management of pharmacotherapy. I have faith that this multidimensional framework will generate a real operational network for biological understanding and predictability of drug behavior."

I have a strong background in molecular biology, genomics, computational and systems biology. During my PhD, I was trained in both experimental biology and bioinformatics to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with treatment response in rectal cancer, and to find molecular biomarkers predictive of treatment efficacy. During my postdoctoral fellowship, I substantially improved my knowledge of computational and systems biology, and network medicine. I worked with omic data, and the application of network methods to a wide range of problems, including the study of regulatory differences between cell lines and their tissues of origin, tissue-specific gene regulation, the association of PD1 pathway regulation with survival in glioblastoma, and the study of sex differences in healthy tissues and in colon cancer. My collection of network models (which include healthy and disease tissues) are publicly available and are a valuable resource for future research on network disruptions that lead to diseases. I have been funded by the American Lung Association to explore sex differences in lung cancer survival outcomes and uncover therapeutic targets via sex-specific gene regulatory networks. My ongoing K01 grant focus on studying the molecular mechanisms driving sex differences in COPD onset and heterogeneity using integrative multi-omic data analysis and network-based approaches. My academic training and research experience in multiple disciplines, including molecular, computational and systems biology, make me well suited to mentor and contribute to research projects using multi-omics and network approaches to better understand sex-based differences in lung diseases and identify more tailored and effective treatment strategies."
