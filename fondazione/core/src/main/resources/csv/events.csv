In many instances, the choice was either to sacrifice the fetus or to jeopardize the chances of administering an effective treatment to the mother. Many advances have been made in the last 15 years and this situation, albeit still difficult to manage, has now completely changed: in most instances the mother’s cancer can be treated during the pregnancy without harming the fetus. The most common cancers in pregnancy are those with a peak incidence during the woman‘s reproductive period and include cancer of the breast and cervix, melanomas, lymphomas, and leukemias. As the trend for delaying pregnancy into the later reproductive years continues, this rare association is likely to become more common. Several medical, psychological, social, and ethical issues should be considered when treating a pregnant patient with cancer and a multidisciplinary team of trained professionals should be available within a hub and spoke model, to offer each pregnant mother with cancer, to her physician and all members of the oncology team, adequate care and support. In this 2-days congress, all the different aspects of cancer and pregnancy will be discussed by a panel of international experts that have significantly contributed to elucidating epidemiology, biology and best treatment for each oncological disease diagnosed during pregnancy. Enough time will be reserved for case discussion, exchanging opinions and thoughts in addition to the presentation of new data in the poster discussion session.

Echo Hong Kong is the first-of-its-kind conference solely dedicated to echocardiography in the Asia Pacific region with live demonstration and hands-on workshops on patients having variety of cardiovascular diseases. Our goal is to provide top quality training and education to cardiologists and medical professionals. Through scientific exchange and experience sharing, delegates will gain practical knowledge and skills to enhance clinical cardiovascular patient care. Since its inception in 1997, the bi-annual Echo Hong Kong has attracted thousands of delegates from all over the world. The feedback is overwhelmingly excellent and encouraging. <br />With the theme &quot;From Imaging to Excellence in Clinical Management&quot;, a stimulating program including state-of-the-art lectures, debates, case studies with the experts, live demonstration, hands-on workshops &amp; learning labs, echo case &amp; clinical case competitions has been developed. New &amp; special this year, we have added a full-day Sunday session on Clinical Cardiology: &quot;Pearls &amp; Wisdom from the Masters &amp; Experts for Clinical Excellence in Patient Management&quot; in the Conference. Internationally renowned speakers &amp; teachers around the world have been invited as our esteemed faculty. Cardiologists, physicians, emergency room or critical care physicians, anaesthetists, nurses, sonographers and professionals with interest in echocardiography and cardiology will all benefit from this clinically oriented scientific program. <br />Don&#39;t miss out our well-received hands-on workshops as capacity is always exceeded early in the course of registration and we have to turn down numerous late comers in order to maintain quality interactions. We are confident that the upcoming meeting will bring to our delegates an insightful &amp; rewarding learning experience, as well as fostering friendship with colleagues around the world.

The first epicenter in Europe was Italy in February-March and particularly the Northern region of Lombardy, causing in whole country approximately 240.000 infections and 35.000 fatalities. Other heavily affected European countries were Spain, France, the UK and Russia. COVID-19 then spread to the Americas with a first epicenter in April in New York City, causing in the USA at least 2.000.000 infections and 115.000 fatalities.In the frame of this dramatic global scenario there is still considerable uncertainty pertaining to the mechanisms of viral spread and the factors that contribute to the different degree of disease severity. It is plausible that an environmental risk factor such as ambient air pollution characterized by a high population attributable fraction plays a key role in increasing the likelihood of spread and severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19, because ambient air pollution has an adverse impact on global morbidity and mortality through components such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). They affect human health by producing oxidative stress and inflammation, that is turn cause damage on the respiratory, cardiovascular and immune systems definitely involved in COVID-19. With this background, it is biologically plausible that the degree and duration of exposure to air pollution might have harmful effects on the occurrence and clinical course of COVID-19.With these gaps of knowledge this webinar is planned to contribute to a better understanding on whether or not short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution influences the spread and clinical manifestations of COVID-19.

Since then, research on the health effects of air pollution have progressed considerably. The Health Effects Institute, the European Respiratory Society (ERS), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) organized a joint meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on January 21-22, 2020 with the aim to review the latest science on major pollutants, focusing on particulate matter 2.5 μm or less in diameter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), to help evaluate the need for updating Europe’s air quality policies.

The first epicenter was in January the city of Wuhan and caused in the whole China 84.000 infected cases and 4600 deaths. The first epicenter in Europe was Italy in February-March and particularly the Northern region of Lombardy, causing in whole country approximately 240.000 infections and 35.000 fatalities. Other heavily affected European countries were Spain, France, the UK and Russia.

In the frame of this dramatic global scenario there is still considerable uncertainty pertaining to the mechanisms of viral spread and the factors that contribute to the different degree of disease severity. It is plausible that an environmental risk factor such as ambient air pollution characterized by a high population attributable fraction plays a key role in increasing the likelihood of spread and severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19, because ambient air pollution has an adverse impact on global morbidity and mortality through components such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). They affect human health by producing oxidative stress and inflammation, that is turn cause damage on the respiratory, cardiovascular and immune systems definitely involved in COVID-19. With this background, it is biologically plausible that the degree and duration of exposure to air pollution might have harmful effects on the occurrence and clinical course of COVID-19. With these gaps of knowledge this webinar is planned to contribute to a better understanding on whether or not short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution influences the spread and clinical manifestations of COVID-19.

Ever since its discovery, H. pylori has aroused great scientific interest with <br/> controversial opinions involving numerous medical disciplines, and it has become an exemplary model because of its medical multi- and interdisciplinarity. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> For this reason we believe that in the context of the H. pylori Consensus development, which combines a challenging academic exercise with the demand to come up with useful clinical guidance, a series of accompanying webinars would be <br/> useful for educational purposes in clinical medicine and related scientific disciplines. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> The contents of these educational webinars will include methodological aspects on how to select relevant questions, provide evidence, proceed with the assessment of individual statements, deal with controversies, and finally, on how to <br/> reach a consensus. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> Authoritative experts in the H. pylori field will give concise presentations with up-to-date knowledge on clinical scenarios, diagnostic procedures, therapeutic strategies, preventive measures, and the interaction of H. pylori with the <br/> gut microbiota. Specific aspects, such as the role of H. pylori eradication in patients with myocardial infarction, and H. pylori related clinical challenges in times of COVID-19, will add important actuality to our endeavours. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> We hope to stimulate your curiosity and interest to follow the webinars accompanying the H. pylori consensus development in the aim of benefitting your daily clinical and academic practice. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> <em>Course Coordinator:</em><br/> <b>P.

Ever since its discovery, H. pylori has aroused great scientific interest with <br/> controversial opinions involving numerous medical disciplines, and it has become an exemplary model because of its medical multi- and interdisciplinarity. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> For this reason we believe that in the context of the H. pylori Consensus development, which combines a challenging academic exercise with the demand to come up with useful clinical guidance, a series of accompanying webinars would be <br/> useful for educational purposes in clinical medicine and related scientific disciplines. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> The contents of these educational webinars will include methodological aspects on how to select relevant questions, provide evidence, proceed with the assessment of individual statements, deal with controversies, and finally, on how to <br/> reach a consensus. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> Authoritative experts in the H. pylori field will give concise presentations with up-to-date knowledge on clinical scenarios, diagnostic procedures, therapeutic strategies, preventive measures, and the interaction of H. pylori with the <br/> gut microbiota. Specific aspects, such as the role of H. pylori eradication in patients with myocardial infarction, and H. pylori related clinical challenges in times of COVID-19, will add important actuality to our endeavours. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> We hope to stimulate your curiosity and interest to follow the webinars accompanying the H. pylori consensus development in the aim of benefitting your daily clinical and academic practice. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> <em>Course Coordinator:</em><br/> <b>P.

Ever since its discovery, H. pylori has aroused great scientific interest with <br/> controversial opinions involving numerous medical disciplines, and it has become an exemplary model because of its medical multi- and interdisciplinarity. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> For this reason we believe that in the context of the H. pylori Consensus development, which combines a challenging academic exercise with the demand to come up with useful clinical guidance, a series of accompanying webinars would be <br/> useful for educational purposes in clinical medicine and related scientific disciplines. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> The contents of these educational webinars will include methodological aspects on how to select relevant questions, provide evidence, proceed with the assessment of individual statements, deal with controversies, and finally, on how to <br/> reach a consensus. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> Authoritative experts in the H. pylori field will give concise presentations with up-to-date knowledge on clinical scenarios, diagnostic procedures, therapeutic strategies, preventive measures, and the interaction of H. pylori with the <br/> gut microbiota. Specific aspects, such as the role of H. pylori eradication in patients with myocardial infarction, and H. pylori related clinical challenges in times of COVID-19, will add important actuality to our endeavours. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> We hope to stimulate your curiosity and interest to follow the webinars accompanying the H. pylori consensus development in the aim of benefitting your daily clinical and academic practice. <br/> </p> <br/> <br/> <p> <br/> <em>Course Coordinator:</em><br/> <b>P.

Thanks to Fondazione Menarini, we will be hosted in one <br/> of the most beautiful venues in Milan: Fondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli. <br/> </p><p>We hope you will enjoy the Course, <br/> <br/> <br/> </p><div> <br/> <br/> </div><div>Andrea Ferrari</div><div>Fedro Peccatori</div>","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/810/the_program/cover/0f4c11650a104c1481840e3d512aae47_Programma_19Sept_Milano_24.pdf.jpg?ver=zY1N_SzbtbpNmy_ag1lRWA%3d%3d","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/810/the_program/0f4c11650a104c1481840e3d512aae47_Programma_19Sept_Milano_24.pdf?ver=pwtTkSEDtnsiu_IMw7Qy8g%3d%3d",,"event","19",,,"none",

Conversely – what we now would like to call, in a new <br/> comprehensive term – “myocardial ischemic syndromes” may recognize causes unrelated to <br/> the easily visible epicardial obstructive lesions.

Conversely – what we now would like to call, in a new comprehensive term – “myocardial ischemic syndromes” may recognize causes unrelated to the easily visible epicardial obstructive lesions. These may be explained by an interplay of vasoreactivity, inflammation, dissections, metabolic changes and – occasionally – extra-coronary or iatrogenic causes. Coronary causes may occur both in the large epicardial vessels and in the coronary microcirculation. Changes in myocardial metabolism may also cause or worsen myocardial ischemic syndromes. Most important, causes of myocardial ischemic syndromes often likely act in concert, also explaining the inadequacy of purely mechanical epicardial coronary interventions in “non-acute” myocardial ischemic syndromes. Recognizing the multiplicity of causes for myocardial ischemic syndromes paves the way to individualized, patient-tailored therapeutic approaches, clearly different in different settings.<br/>This expert meeting will offer an update on risk factors, mechanisms, diagnostics and management of myocardial ischemic syndromes summoning a group of world-class experts with ample space devoted to discussions and interaction. An important aspect of the meeting will be devoted to proposing a new nomenclature of “myocardial ischemic syndromes”, overarching current terminologies, notably still different between European and American cardiological societies. The meeting is dedicated to a restricted number of cardiology, cardiac surgery and internal medicine specialists.</span></p><p><b>Raffaele De Caterina</b><br/>Chair and Postgraduate School of Cardiology<br/>University of Pisa<br/><br/><b>Director</b><br/>University Cardiology Division<br/>Pisa University Hospital<br/><br/>Pisa, Italy</p>","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/829/the_program/cover/ec29a301fe8d41d08fc47b94b113cd44_Programma_16-17Giugno_Pisa_web.pdf.jpg?ver=2JvIkthJTe9M0_2mAGEmPA%3d%3d","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/829/the_program/ec29a301fe8d41d08fc47b94b113cd44_Programma_16-17Giugno_Pisa_web.pdf?ver=myF4F_9rPV_fqsvd2bC7Rg%3d%3d",,"event","22",,,"healthcare","website"

Of particular interest and relevance is the report that, at the end of this opening session, evaluates the economic consequences of the impacts of air pollution on health.</div><div>The next four sessions of the first day of the Seminar update the current scientific evidence on the relation to air pollution exposure of four frequent noncommunicable diseases: cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, tumors as well as neurological and mental disease. The last session of the day is an innovative and until now poorly attempted effort to stimulate a cross-talk between medical specialists and general</div><div>practitioners with epidemiologists to understand the relevance for clinical practice of the accumulated evidence on the adverse effects of air pollution, and the role of clinicians in using this evidence with their patients. Equally important and cogent are the scientific sessions of the conference’s second day.<br/><br/></div><div>The poster presentation session deals with the update of research conducted on air pollution in Italy, a country characterized by a high degree of exposure, particularly but not exclusively in the northern region of the river Po valley. The next session evaluates the issues and recent progress in the assessment of the degree of exposure to air pollution, by using not only the traditional models of epidemiology but also</div><div>other equally effective and perhaps less costly approaches. The last session reports the policy and actions planned for the European Union and the UK to reduce the health risks of air pollution. The Seminar ends with a discussion and related reporting on which further evidence is warranted in order to support actions designed to reduce the health risks of air pollution in Europe and elsewhere.<br/><br/></div><div>The audience of the seminar will include scientists involved in the research on health effects of air pollution, public health specialists, experts on air quality assessment and management as well as representatives of organizations involved in actions designed to reduce health impacts of air pollution. The multidisciplinary discussion will serve both for better communication of the scientific knowledge to the wide public and identification of further questions to be addressed by research in order to improve prevention of the adverse impacts of air pollution on health.</div><div><br/><br/><br/>Francesco Forastiere</div><div>Sergio A.
