In many instances, the choice was either to sacrifice the fetus or to jeopardize the chances of administering an effective treatment to the mother. Many advances have been made in the last 15 years and this situation, albeit still difficult to manage, has now completely changed: in most instances the mother’s cancer can be treated during the pregnancy without harming the fetus. The most common cancers in pregnancy are those with a peak incidence during the woman‘s reproductive period and include cancer of the breast and cervix, melanomas, lymphomas, and leukemias. As the trend for delaying pregnancy into the later reproductive years continues, this rare association is likely to become more common. Several medical, psychological, social, and ethical issues should be considered when treating a pregnant patient with cancer and a multidisciplinary team of trained professionals should be available within a hub and spoke model, to offer each pregnant mother with cancer, to her physician and all members of the oncology team, adequate care and support. In this 2-days congress, all the different aspects of cancer and pregnancy will be discussed by a panel of international experts that have significantly contributed to elucidating epidemiology, biology and best treatment for each oncological disease diagnosed during pregnancy. Enough time will be reserved for case discussion, exchanging opinions and thoughts in addition to the presentation of new data in the poster discussion session.

Lifestyle, environment, and genetics, pose as risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of risk factors among healthy individuals (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and psychosocial stress) predicts the occurrence of CAD in the near future. The diagnostic management of patients with angina pectoris typically aims at the detection of obstructive epicardial CAD. This clinical paradigm fails to account for the considerable proportion (approximately one-third) of patients with angina in whom obstructive CAD is excluded. This common scenario presents a diagnostic conundrum whereby angina occurs but there is no obstructive CAD (ischaemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease—INOCA). The proper management of CAD and modification of its morbid course has been established through extensive studies and trials. RAS blockers, statins and aspirin are used for the secondary prevention of the disease , and revascularization when indicated, nitrates, β-blockers, calcium antagonists, ivabradine, trimetazidine and ranolazine are some of the therapeutic approaches used for the symptomatic relief of angina associated with CAD. In our scientific program we are going to discuss the most important risk factors related to CHD, with focus on hypertension and other consequences of CHD, and the recent published ESC guidelines for acute pulmonary embolism, dyslipidaemias, diabetes pre-diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and supraventricular arrhythmias. Experts from all around the world will discuss the hot topics of the just presented ESC guidelines on CHD, and we are going to have a critical approach of them in two panel discussions.

Through scientific exchange and experience sharing, delegates will gain practical knowledge and skills to enhance clinical cardiovascular patient care. Since its inception in 1997, the bi-annual Echo Hong Kong has attracted thousands of delegates from all over the world. The feedback is overwhelmingly excellent and encouraging. With the theme ""From Imaging to Excellence in Clinical Management"", a stimulating program including state-of-the-art lectures, debates, case studies with the experts, live demonstration, hands-on workshops & learning labs, echo case & clinical case competitions has been developed. New & special this year, we have added a full-day Sunday session on Clinical Cardiology: ""Pearls & Wisdom from the Masters & Experts for Clinical Excellence in Patient Management"" in the Conference. Internationally renowned speakers & teachers around the world have been invited as our esteemed faculty. Cardiologists, physicians, emergency room or critical care physicians, anaesthetists, nurses, sonographers and professionals with interest in echocardiography and cardiology will all benefit from this clinically oriented scientific program. Don't miss out our well-received hands-on workshops as capacity is always exceeded early in the course of registration and we have to turn down numerous late comers in order to maintain quality interactions. We are confident that the upcoming meeting will bring to our delegates an insightful & rewarding learning experience, as well as fostering friendship with colleagues around the world.

Per questi motivi il 46° Corso è rivolto sia ai clinici che ai laboratoristi. <p> <strong>Prof. Pier Mannuccio Mannucci</strong> Responsabile scientifico <p> <img src=""/Portals/19/Eventi_Conclusi_PDF/Presentazione/2019/NAPOLI25-26Novembre2019-banner.jpg"" alt="""" />","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/705/the_program/cover/bf0ccac36a0d4f54a72bec3e4b6790cd_NAPOLI25-26Novembre2019-programma.pdf.jpg?ver=2019-11-15-093935-710","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/705/the_program/bf0ccac36a0d4f54a72bec3e4b6790cd_NAPOLI25-26Novembre2019-programma.pdf?ver=2019-11-15-093934-657"

Few medical conditions are more traumatic than sudden cardiac death (SCD), not anticipated by any symptom, of a young person. It is a rare event, generally linked to a fatal arrhythmia, but its dramatic presentation and the impact on the family and the whole community finds an amplified resonance in the cases of athletes, perfectly exemplifying the metaphor of a vulnerability hidden in an apparently healthy body. In the general population, there is great concern about juvenile SCD risk, a perception even greater than that experienced in more frequent fatal conditions, such as accidents, suicides, violence. Overall, it is justified to consider the SCD of the young as a threat to global health. The development of strategies based on both scientific evidences and expert consensus is therefore required to reduce the impact of juvenile SCD. SCD in young people, including about 25% of cases occurring during sports activities, is rare (estimated incidence is between 1 and 10 cases/100000 people/year), but its impact in terms of years of life lost is considerable, given the long life expectancy of young people. Cardiac arrest in a young person can be caused by hereditary conditions, such as hypertrophic, dilated and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, or mutations that alter the proteins that control the heart rhythm causing diseases in which the patient’s heart, while appearing normal to clinical investigations, is predisposed to have serious arrhythmias (the so-called channelopathies: long QT syndrome and short QT, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). In the individual patient, these conditions can be asymptomatic and undiagnosed, so that sudden cardiac death may be the first clinical manifestation. It is estimated that cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the widespread availability of external semi-automatic defibrillators could prevent about a quarter of juvenile SCD. The topic of SCD in the young will be addressed by experts evaluating pathophysiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic issues related to this fatal condition. Thanks to the Fondazione Menarini, we will have the opportunity to meet in Pisa, one of the most beautiful cities in Tuscany, in a workshop endorsed by all the University and Research organizations of the city, currently involved in a research project on juvenile SCD. We hope that participating to this workshop will be as interesting and stimulating as its organization.","<p>When a death occurs in professional sport context or in any apparently healthy young individual, public opinion demands an adequate response from the clinical and scientific community.

The first epicenter in Europe was Italy in February-March and particularly the Northern region of Lombardy, causing in whole country approximately 240.000 infections and 35.000 fatalities. Other heavily affected European countries were Spain, France, the UK and Russia. COVID-19 then spread to the Americas with a first epicenter in April in New York City, causing in the USA at least 2.000.000 infections and 115.000 fatalities.In the frame of this dramatic global scenario there is still considerable uncertainty pertaining to the mechanisms of viral spread and the factors that contribute to the different degree of disease severity. It is plausible that an environmental risk factor such as ambient air pollution characterized by a high population attributable fraction plays a key role in increasing the likelihood of spread and severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19, because ambient air pollution has an adverse impact on global morbidity and mortality through components such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). They affect human health by producing oxidative stress and inflammation, that is turn cause damage on the respiratory, cardiovascular and immune systems definitely involved in COVID-19. With this background, it is biologically plausible that the degree and duration of exposure to air pollution might have harmful effects on the occurrence and clinical course of COVID-19.With these gaps of knowledge this webinar is planned to contribute to a better understanding on whether or not short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution influences the spread and clinical manifestations of COVID-19.

The first epicenter was in January the city of Wuhan and caused in the whole China 84.000 infected cases and 4600 deaths. The first epicenter in Europe was Italy in February-March and particularly the Northern region of Lombardy, causing in whole country approximately 240.000 infections and 35.000 fatalities. Other heavily affected European countries were Spain, France, the UK and Russia. COVID-19 then spread to the Americas with a first epicenter in April in New York City, causing in the USA at least 2.000.000 infections and 115.000 fatalities. In the frame of this dramatic global scenario there is still considerable uncertainty pertaining to the mechanisms of viral spread and the factors that contribute to the different degree of disease severity. It is plausible that an environmental risk factor such as ambient air pollution characterized by a high population attributable fraction plays a key role in increasing the likelihood of spread and severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19, because ambient air pollution has an adverse impact on global morbidity and mortality through components such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). They affect human health by producing oxidative stress and inflammation, that is turn cause damage on the respiratory, cardiovascular and immune systems definitely involved in COVID-19. With this background, it is biologically plausible that the degree and duration of exposure to air pollution might have harmful effects on the occurrence and clinical course of COVID-19. With these gaps of knowledge this webinar is planned to contribute to a better understanding on whether or not short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution influences the spread and clinical manifestations of COVID-19. It is hoped that this initiative will update on the latest evidence and help to support and foster globally public health interventions targeted to protect people living in heavily polluted regions through efforts aimed to lower the emissions of the harmful components of ambient air. </span> <p> <p><strong><span style=""color: #800000; font-size: 14pt;"">RATIONALE OF SESSION II and III</span></strong> <p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The Respirami 3 conference in Milan in January 2019 (http://www.ilpolmone.it/congresso-respirami-milano-2019) was a remarkable event with a large participation of international scientists, professionals of the health care sector and environmental protection agencies, all providing an interesting update of the research on air pollution.

The first epicenter was in January the city of Wuhan and caused in the whole China 84.000 infected cases and 4600 deaths. The first epicenter in Europe was Italy in February-March and particularly the Northern region of Lombardy, causing in whole country approximately 240.000 infections and 35.000 fatalities. Other heavily affected European countries were Spain, France, the UK and Russia. COVID-19 then spread to the Americas with a first epicenter in April in New York City, causing in the USA at least 2.000.000 infections and 115.000 fatalities. In the frame of this dramatic global scenario there is still considerable uncertainty pertaining to the mechanisms of viral spread and the factors that contribute to the different degree of disease severity. It is plausible that an environmental risk factor such as ambient air pollution characterized by a high population attributable fraction plays a key role in increasing the likelihood of spread and severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19, because ambient air pollution has an adverse impact on global morbidity and mortality through components such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). They affect human health by producing oxidative stress and inflammation, that is turn cause damage on the respiratory, cardiovascular and immune systems definitely involved in COVID-19. With this background, it is biologically plausible that the degree and duration of exposure to air pollution might have harmful effects on the occurrence and clinical course of COVID-19. With these gaps of knowledge this webinar is planned to contribute to a better understanding on whether or not short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution influences the spread and clinical manifestations of COVID-19. It is hoped that this initiative will update on the latest evidence and help to support and foster globally public health interventions targeted to protect people living in heavily polluted regions through efforts aimed to lower the emissions of the harmful components of ambient air. </span> <p> <p><strong><span style=""color: #800000; font-size: 14pt;"">RATIONALE OF SESSION II and III</span></strong> <p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The Respirami 3 conference in Milan in January 2019 (http://www.ilpolmone.it/congresso-respirami-milano-2019) was a remarkable event with a large participation of international scientists, professionals of the health care sector and environmental protection agencies, all providing an interesting update of the research on air pollution.

The World Economic Forum has defined antibiotic resistance as a global risk, which is not limited to health alone. The increase in life expectancy and advances in surgery, transplantology, oncology, haematology and resuscitation have increased and made patients more vulnerable to infections contracted in hospital or during healthcare, so it is estimated that without new drugs, by 2050 the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance could cause 450,000 deaths in Italy alone. New antibiotics would be able to reduce mortality by a third, from now on saving 3,000 lives each year. Antibiotic resistance is therefore a hot topic and the purpose of this training course is to take stock of the situation and describe new strategies for fighting this phenomenon. The spectre of a pre-antibiotic era, which would take us back a hundred years, is stretching inexorably over global public health due to super-resistant bacteria. Already today, they kill 33,000 people in Europe every year, and 10,000 in Italy alone, the most affected nation together with Greece, and almost 5% of hospitalised patients suffer from an infection that cannot be treated with common antibiotics. The forecasts for the future are very serious and to be able to fight the battle against multi-resistant germs it is necessary to boost research and encourage the use of new antibiotics, true lifesavers like the anticancer drugs, thus overcoming the paradox of “not treating an infection today for fear that it will become more serious or less curable tomorrow”. By 2050, it is expected that there will be 392,000 deaths in Europe, 10 million worldwide, and about 450,000 in Italy, surpassing the mortality rate for cancer, with an economic impact of 100 trillion dollars. An emergency that could be overcome thanks, on the one hand, to new antibiotics by intensifying scientific research and, on the other hand, by making the best use of the most innovative drugs. It is therefore essential for the new antibiotics to be used earlier on, even in an appropriate empirical way, above all for the most critical and serious patients in which a delay, even a few hours, in starting the right antibiotic therapy, could be fatal. The fight against antibiotic resistance cannot be separated from the training of doctors: many do not know about the new drugs and are afraid to use them. Only 35% use them, often with a delay, wasting precious time and exposing patients to a greater risk of serious complications. A change of pace is indispensable because simple prevention is no longer sufficient: even by administering antibiotics only when necessary and paying close attention to the containment of infections and bacterial transmission in hospitals and nursing homes, only 50% of infections acquired during healthcare can be prevented. Antibiotics are therefore still a lifesaver, especially for the numerous fragile patients such as the elderly, patients undergoing organ transplants or cancer treatment, those in intensive care or who have undergone major surgery. It is essential to carry out research to identify new therapies, enhancing the value of innovative antibiotics, which, when included in appropriate therapeutic schemes, will allow for protecting the efforts and investments made in support of patient health with huge savings of resources, in both the short and long term. <p> <p> <h4><span style=""color: #800000;"">Prof. Matteo Bassetti <em>Infectious Diseases Clinic, University of Genoa, Hospital Policlinico San Martino – IRCCS, Genoa, Italy</em></span></h4>","<p>Antibiotic-resistant super-bacteria kill thousands of patients each year.

This digital international symposium on airway surgery was conceived with a view to promoting the spread of culture in the field of airway surgery in children and to create the basis for a distance education system with a practical character. <h5 style=""text-decoration-color: initial; margin: 0px 0px 14px; border: 0px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 18px; font-family: merriweather_sansbold, sans-serif; color: #ae0f0a;""><span style=""border: 0px; font: inherit; color: #800000;"">Scientific Director: Sergio Bottero</span></h5>","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/755/the_program/cover/d3644f70937f472daf2219137449d37d_Scientific_Program_Pediatrics_5-12-19mar21.pdf.jpg?ver=DSvI8RjAKEBJnfGMaPXviQ%3d%3d","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/755/the_program/d3644f70937f472daf2219137449d37d_Scientific_Program_Pediatrics_5-12-19mar21.pdf?ver=xH12lr1jS7dU_P28eRFJBQ%3d%3d"

Despite breast cancer being a common disease in older women, few evidence-based recommendations exist upon which oncologists can ground their clinical decisions.

Because a huge number of individuals are currently exposed to this risk in high-income as well as in low-income countries, the health care and public health dimensions of its consequences are impressive, considering that, according to global data stemming concordantly from WHO and the Global Burden of Disease epidemiological study, at least 7 million premature deaths are due to ambient and household air pollution. With this background, together with the team of epidemiologists from Lazio (led by Francesco Forastiere and Massimo Stafoggia) plus a former staff member of WHO (Michal Krzyzanowski), first in 2015 we chose to organize every three years an independent international seminar called RespiraMi, with the goal to gather the most distinguished global experts and prompt them to present their recent and mostly unpublished data on the progress of science towards tackling the global issue of outdoor and indoor air pollution. The fourth 2022 edition and scientific program of the Seminar (RespiraMi 4) enlists a faculty of speakers from four continents (Europe, North America and Asia), who will put special emphasis on the effects of air pollution on the weakest groups of world citizens: the newborn, pregnant women, older and poorest people, as well as on the growing evidence that air pollution is a cause of most common, growing and devastating neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson and dementia. The 2022 International Seminar “Recent Advances on Air Pollution and Health” will be organized as a hybrid event lasting two days in Milan, on June 17 and 18, in order to provide insights not only on the current state of the art but also a look on to the future of air quality and related research efforts. Session 1 will summarize the new and recent evidence that prompted WHO to release the updated Air Quality Guidelines (AQG), designed to preserve better than the previous guidelines health state of citizens of the whole world on the basis of new evidence on the deleterious effects even of low levels of pollutants. The session will also offer new evidence on the effects on health of specific pollutants such as NO2 and biomass burning emissions. Session 2 will deal with new aspects pertaining to several damages of air pollution on human health, with special emphasis on outcomes such as mental health and cognitive development as well as on pregnancy complications. Session 3 will offer a systematic review of selected effects of traffic-related air pollution, with special emphasis on mortality but also on morbidity for cardiovascular and respiratory disease and on birth outcomes. Session 4 will provide new evidence on the beneficial effects of greenness and how to best design the ecosystem service of trees and ornamental potted plants in order to reduce indoor and outdoor pollution. Session 5 deals with the burden of diseases stemming from major air pollution sources, with specific evidence from highly polluted countries from the third world such as India, Nigeria and Ghana. Session 6 will tackle the formidable challenges warranted to achieve a cleaner air and illustrate in this context the European Green Deal program, as well as the ongoing plan to update the European air quality legislation. Session 7 will feature the current burden of air pollution in Italy and the role of Italian researchers from the Network on Environment and Health, and will also feature the impact on ambient air pollution of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in Milan and Rome. Finally, Session 8 will be based on a panel discussion addressing the questions of future planning of research on air pollution, and we expect to get comments and suggestions by the live but also remote audience to the Seminar.

Il Corso si avvale dei maggiori esperti italiani ed internazionali sui 3 argomenti e sarà disponibile anche alla fruizione on-line. <p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Prof. Lorenzo Corbetta President of the Meeting</strong>","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/804/the_program/cover/14af27b005fd47cf94213c2c1227980f_Programma_fiesole pulmonology11.pdf.jpg?ver=1c2iZMqtbySXQCjVkF_KQw%3d%3d","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/804/the_program/14af27b005fd47cf94213c2c1227980f_Programma_fiesole pulmonology11.pdf?ver=2Oadb5aPMwy1a9m5kCY6eg%3d%3d"

Although the International Task Force criteriademonstrated a good accuracy for diagnosis of the original right ventricular phenotype (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy), they lacked sensitivity for identification of theexpanding phenotypic spectrum of ACM, which includes left-sided variants and did not incorporate late-gadolinium enhancement findings by cardiac magnetic resonance. The lack of specificdiagnostic criteria for the left ventricular phenotype of ACM has resulted in clinical under-recognition of patients with phenotypes other than the original ARVC over the 4 decades since thedisease discovery. The development of the 2020 upgrading of diagnostic criteria (“the Paduacriteria”) by International experts was based on the evolving clinical experience with the expanding spectrum of ACM phenotypes and needed to fill the diagnostic gap of the previous 1994 and2010 TF guidelines. The key upgrade was the incorporation of tissue characterization findingsby cardiac magnetic resonance for noninvasive detection of late-gadolinium enhancement/myocardial fibrosis that are determinants for characterization of arrhythmogenic biventricularand left ventricular phenotypes. and to provide a codification for future translational and clinicalresearch. The 2020 Padua criteria are heavily dependent on cardiac magnetic resonance, whichhas become mandatory to characterize the ACM phenotype and to exclude other diagnoses. Newcriteria regarding left ventricular depolarization and repolarization ECG abnormalities and ventricular arrhythmias of left ventricular origin were also provided. The 2020 Padua criteria aimedto improve the diagnosis of ACM by providing new criteria for diagnosis of biventricular and ALVCphenotypes, particularly by means of the incorporation of CMR tissue characterization findingsas well as LV depolarization and repolarization ECG abnormalities and ventricular arrhythmias.This new diagnostic approach needs to be validated by clinical studies on large patient populations. Preliminary data confirm that the clinical use of the Padua criteria substantially impactsthe diagnostic accuracy and permits a comprehensive identification of the phenotypic variety ofACM, mostly by virtue of demonstration of RV and LV LGE/myocardial fibrosis by CMR.

This therapeutic approach in chronic airway diseases is characterized by the gradual increase of longacting bronchodilators and/or inhaled corticosteroids. Unfortunately, although this strategy has significantly improved the outcomes of airway diseases, its drawbacks are now evident, and real therapeutic progress in these diseases has virtually come to a standstill. <p style=""text-align: center;""> However, the new paradigm for modern healthcare is a proactive and personalized response to patients’ symptoms, combining precision diagnosis and personalized treatment. In response to the shortcomings of stepwise therapy, a new approach known as the ‘treatable traits’ method has emerged. The “treatable traits” approach involves individually assessing patients for a predetermined list of treatable conditions, then developing and implementing an individualized treatment plan based on this multidimensional evaluation.

This therapeutic approach in chronic airway diseases is characterized by the gradual increase of longacting bronchodilators and/or inhaled corticosteroids. Unfortunately, although this strategy has significantly improved the outcomes of airway diseases, its drawbacks are now evident, and real therapeutic progress in these diseases has virtually come to a standstill. <p style=""text-align: center;""> However, the new paradigm for modern healthcare is a proactive and personalized response to patients’ symptoms, combining precision diagnosis and personalized treatment. In response to the shortcomings of stepwise therapy, a new approach known as the ‘treatable traits’ method has emerged.

Starting from this year, it has decided to organize a series of congresses named “Past, present and future in Pain Medicine”. Education on Pain Medicine is still lacking in large part of the world, and especially in some geographical areas. Those are the places where FIM is going to dedicate part of its future efforts. The first event of 2023 on Pain Medicine is organized in Cancun (Mexico), and will be realized with the scientific and educational support of the Paolo Procacci Foundation and of the Latino-American Federation of Pain Societies (FEDELAT). Its President, Prof. Marco Antonio Narvaez Tamayo, has always granted the best support, suggesting the more renowned Pain Physicians of the different Countries of Latino-America. Also in this occasion, he has granted the best. This edition is also supported by Prof. Rocio Guillen and the entire Local Organizing Committee. The scientific program will start with an intriguing session trying to show how the approach to Pain Patients has changed in the last few years. “Bridging old and new” will put in evidence how the exclusively pharmacologic therapy has been implemented by interventional approach, and how this approach has changed with the support of ultrasounds. The invasive techniques in pain management have grown very much, especially in the last years. For that reason, there is a full session on this aspect of patients’ treatment. The speakers will illustrate the importance of a good radio-anatomical knowledge, which is a basic pre-requisite for the interventional pain management, but also the technical advancements that allow the possibility to treat some specific pain syndromes with neuromodulation or with the use of radiofrequency. The future of Pain Medicine will be designed with presentations on the new horizons and the new therapeutic targets in the management of pain patients. Moreover, new interesting data will be reported on the influence that some “invasive management” has on systemic body reactions, like the immune response. A session on basic and prospectively clinical research on the sigma opioid receptors will close the first day. The second day will be dedicated to the clinical aspects of acute pain. The illustration of the most important acute pain guidelines, presented by a great expert, will open the session. This lecture will be followed by an intriguing and futuristic aspect: prehabilitation in perioperative medicine. A good general physical condition is definitely helping to afford the surgical stress in the best way. Of course, also an optimal strategy in the management of postoperative pain, and the use of a multimodal analgesia are of paramount importance to obtain the best results in surgical patients. These aspects will be clearly illustrated by two gurus of these clinical aspects of perioperative medicine. We cannot forget that all the analgesics, as any other drugs, have side effects. A full session is dedicated to some of them, trying in this occasion to illustrate the most important ones. Large part of the pain patients arriving to the attention of the Pain Physicians are multi-medicated, and it would be important to understand the potential dangers of this clinical condition. Then, respiratory depression (a life-threatening side effect) and opioid induced constipation (a side effect strongly influencing the quality of life) will be illustrated by two world renowned scientists that have spent a lot of their scientific energies to studying the topics.

It is just useless to discuss of the advanced medicine of ancient Egypt, where the first knowledges belong to the first monarchical era (2700 BC).

They accepted with enthusiasm the invitation of the FIM to organize an important educational event, which may represent a new experience and a driving force for the young generations. Pain Medicine deserves the maximum of our attention, because, as our Great Guru, John Bonica (born in the Mediterranean), was used to say: patients should never suffer. <p>As a responsible for the organization of the scientific program, I would deeply thank all the Colleagues and Friends, who were such for large part of my life dedicated to Pain Medicine. They have accepted with enthusiasm to participate in this event and share their knowledge with all of us. All of them are strongly convinced of the importance to exchange information and learn from others the difficult art of reducing the sufferance of the humanity. <p>As we know from recent, dramatic news, this is not always interpreted as a simple and “transparent” mission. When facing suffering people, it could be easy to be attracted by easy earnings. Ethics and comprehension are crucial aspects for a Pain Physician. Maybe in one of the future editions of this educational event, the program will also focuses on these aspects, and not only on the science and the evidence-based results of studies on drugs or on interventional techniques, like it is in this occasion.

Together with this disease there are several other secondary forms of progressive pulmonary fibrosis sharing similar pathogenesis and treatment with IPF. In the recent decades a tremendous effort was made by researchers all over the world to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of IPF and other pulmonary fibrosing disease. The availability of two specific anti-fibrotic drugs, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, represented almost an advancement for the management of a previously orphan and neglected disease. Obviously, there is still a great expectaction for novel more effective therapeutics raising from new disease-paradigms to prevent and even more, to revert excessive tissue scarring in the lungs. This meeting organized by the Fondazione Menarini is aimed to show which are the most promising translational investigations on pulmonary fibrosis to-date giving a look to new insight into cellular and molecular players driving pulmonary fibrosis. All we hope to identify soon specific biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis and follow-up and, at the best, to develop novel effective treatments to improve the still bad prognosis of this devastating disease.

Together with this disease there are several other secondary forms of progressive pulmonary fibrosis sharing similar pathogenesis and treatment with IPF. In the recent decades a tremendous effort was made by researchers all over the world to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of IPF and other pulmonary fibrosing disease. The availability of two specific anti-fibrotic drugs, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, represented almost an advancement for the management of a previously orphan and neglected disease.

Certainly, a symbol of the (re)discovery of the dialogue between the East (represented by the fabulous Cathay) and the West (represented by one of the most beautiful cities in the world: Venice) is epitomized by the incredible journey of Marco Polo, soon imitated by another great and courageous Italian scientist, Matteo Ricci.

The medicine of sexuality is probably the youngest branch of internal medicine. Since its inception as a true science, more or less 25-30 years ago, it has been nourished by dialogue, openness, and by the knowledge of different scientific and cultural expressions that collaborate in the understanding of the biologically most important function of all: the sexual one and the dysfunctions that affect it. This explains the reason for this meeting organized by the Menarini Foundation: a meeting of dialogue between scientists from Italy, where the medicine of sexuality has produced some of the most prolific researchers, accompanied by famous opinion leaders from Europe, America, and other parts of the “Western” world with great scientists from China, where the medicine of sexuality is snowballing, also accompanied by well-known opinion leaders from Korea and Vietnam and other parts of the “Eastern” world. Dialogue and mutual learning are pivotal in every field of science, but above all, in sexual medicine, which increasingly bases its work not only on the hydraulic and pharmacological aspects but on the holistic, indeed systemic, understanding of the couple and their health. Therefore, it appears evident that the millennial tradition of traditional medicines can ideally dialogue with Western diagnostics and therapy of sexual dysfunctions, brilliantly overcoming the difficulties of mutual understanding that there may be present.

With a comprehensive outlook and from a One Health perspective, we shall discuss antimicrobial resistance from veterinary medicine and agriculture in addition to human medicine. Emerging viral threats, difficult-to-treat infections, foodborne zoonoses, arthropod transmitted diseases, and diseases associated with migration and travel will be the main topics of the conference.</span><br style=""text-align: left;"" /><br style=""text-align: left;"" /><p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""float: left;"">Prof. Antonio Cascio</span><span style=""float: right;"">Prof. David Leslie Paterson</span>","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/853/the_program/cover/380f80c2f0054a2caad75bf926c5cd28_Programma_Palermo_14Mar_WEB (1).pdf.jpg?ver=Nj7WWbCX5Pv2CU42WOZNgw%3d%3d","/Portals/19/vgfm/events/853/the_program/380f80c2f0054a2caad75bf926c5cd28_Programma_Palermo_14Mar_WEB (1).pdf?ver=vVKBp36DSLc2SNuz-o_OOg%3d%3d"

While this approach has often been successful, the great majority of diseases are complex and reflect many molecular interactions and responses defined by genomic context and environmental exposures. Given this complexity, the field of network medicine was developed, the fundamental principle of which is that a true understanding of disease definition, etiology, prognosis, and therapy requires a holistic approach to these complex molecular systems. In the current era of ‘big data’ and multi-omic data sets, we are poised to analyze these complex systems as seen through the lens of molecular interaction networks, including protein-protein interaction networks, Bayesian coexpression networks, and others. This new paradigm requires deep learning and artificial intelligence strategies, which, together, will guide us along the path to true precision medicine. Doing so requires a multidisciplinary approach involving experts in applied mathematics, biomedicine, computer science, engineering, and network science, and involves the development of novel analytical strategies for assessing the interactions among and between the elements of these multi-omic networks. This proposed symposium is designed to provide a contemporary, integrated view of this rapidly growing interdisciplinary paradigm, which offers the opportunity to identify novel personalized mechanisms of disease, unique biomarkers for disease prognosis, and novel drug targets for personalized therapies. In these ways, network medicine offers a novel path toward (re)defining and treating human disease in the modern era, and facilitates the development of precision medicine. </span><p style=""text-align: right;""> <strong><span style=""color: #333399;"">Joseph Loscalzo Alberico L.
